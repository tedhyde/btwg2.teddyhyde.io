<h2 id="preface">Preface</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book contains stories about building software tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you write software on a daily basis, you realize the act of
writing software is the craft of creating tools. Software is nothing
more than a tool. A spreadsheet is fundamentally a tool to
add and subtract numbers. A video game is fundamentally a tool to
alleviate boredom. Almost immediately after people started writing
software tools we then discovered we needed more tools to permit us to
write the tools we set out to build in the first place. Let&#8217;s
call these tools that are strictly to support writing software (rather
than software tools for the general population) meta-tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the most important meta-tools in the software development world
is Git. Git is a meta-tool that helps software developers
manage the complexity that comes from writing software. Git allows
software developers to store snapshots of their programs (and then
easily restore those snapshots if necessary) and to easily collaborate
with other programmers (a surprisingly complicated problem). Git is
called a source code management (SCM) tool and though there were many other
SCMs before Git, Git has taken the software world by storm like no
other before it and now dominates the SCM landscape.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub is a company that saw the immense potential of Git early on and
built a layer of web services on top of the existing features found
in Git. Not surprisingly, one of the factors behind its success was that
GitHub employees embraced the ethos of writing meta-tools from the
beginning. Building meta-tools requires the courage to take a little
extra time to build a meta-tool rather than
taking the easy route to get the public-facing software out the
door. GitHub employees are proud of this prioritization and have
written extensively about the benefits, which include easy on-boarding
of new hires and a transparent workflow visible to all employees.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book looks at the tools GitHub uses internally. The
GitHub.com website is itself a meta-tool, and we discuss the many
facets of the GitHub service. Specifically these technologies are the
GitHub API and related GitHub technologies, Gollum wiki, Jekyll
static  page generator, and the chat robot called Hubot (if you are
not familiar with any of these, we&#8217;ll explain them fully in their
respective chapters).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To reiterate, this book is not a reference of those technologies. This
book is a story-book, a book that relates the process of building
software meta-tools, explaining not only the technology specifics, but
also the compromises, the realities of refactoring, and the challenges
inherent to writing meta-tools in long narrative story
form.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meta-tools require a different mindset than what comes from
building software available to the general population. Meta-tools are
generally open source, which requires a
different level of responsibility and usage. One could argue that
software engineers are more demanding of quality than general users
because software developers know they can take action to improve or
fork software that does not work for them. Meta-tools enforce a higher
level of contributory involvement, which makes automated tests
almost a requirement. All of these concepts constitute the background
story behind meta-tools, and we show you how they play out when
building your own.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_why_apis_and_why_the_github_api">Why APIs and Why the GitHub API?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using an API to back an application is a common practice today: this
is the future of application development. APIs provide a great pattern
for making data accessible to the multiscreen world. If your
application is backed by a remote service API, the
first application could be a mobile app running on Apple&#8217;s iOS
operating system. Critically, if that business model does not turn out
to be correct, you can respond quickly to changing requirements and
iterate to build another application for an Android wearable. Or,
perhaps you&#8217;ll build an integrated car application, or any other
console (or even nonconsole) application. As long as your applications
can send and receive data using calls to a remote API you are free to
build whatever user interface you want on whatever platform you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an author, you could write and host your own API. Many frameworks
for popular languages like Ruby, Go, or Java support building APIs
using standard architectural styles like REST. Or, you could use a
third-party API. In this book we&#8217;ll focus on a third-party API: the
GitHub API.</p>

<p>Why the GitHub API? The GitHub API is exceedingly relevant if you are
building software because you are probably using GitHub to manage your
software code. For those that aren&#8217;t, you might be using Git without
GitHub, and the GitHub API is useful to know there as well, as it
layers the functionality of Git into a networked programming interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub API is perhaps the best designed API I&#8217;ve ever used. It is
a Hypermedia API, which is an arguably successful attempt to make
API clients resilient to API changes&#x2014;a tricky problem. The API is well
versioned. It is comprehensive, mapping closely to most features of
Git. It is consistent across sections and well organized. The GitHub
API is a great API on which to build applications, serving as a
case study for a well-designed API.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_structure_of_this_book">Structure of This Book</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub API is extremely comprehensive, permitting access and
modification of almost all data and metadata stored or associated with
a Git repository. Here is a grouped summary of the sections of the API ordered
alphabetically as they are on the <a href="https://developer.github.com/v3/">GitHub API documentation site</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Activity: notifications of interesting events in your developer life</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gists: programmatically create and share code snippets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git Data: raw access to Git data over a remote API</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Issues: add and modify issues</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Miscellaneous: whatever does not fit into the general API
categorization</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Organizations: access and retrieve organizational membership data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull Requests: a powerful API layer on the popular merge process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Repositories: modify everything and anything related to repositories</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Search: code-driven search within the entire GitHub database</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users: access user data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enterprise: specifics about using the API when using the private
corporate GitHub</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, though not a part of the API, there are other important
technologies you should know about when using GitHub that are not
covered in the API documentation:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Jekyll and "gh-pages": hosting blogs and static documentation</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Gollum: wikis tied to a repository</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubot: a programmable chat robot used extensively at GitHub</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these sections of the GitHub technology stack are covered in
various chapters (with two exceptions, which we explain next). The GitHub API
documentation is a stellar reference you will use constantly
when writing any application that talks to the API, but the chapters
in this book serve a different purpose:
these chapters are stories about building applications on top of
the technologies provided by GitHub. Within these stories you will learn
the trade-offs and considerations you will face when you use the GitHub
API. Chapters in this book often cover multiple pieces of the API
when appropriate for the story we are telling. We&#8217;ve generally tried
to focus on a major API section and limit exposure to other pieces as
much as possible, but most chapters do need to bring in small pieces
of more than one section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is a short synopsis of each chapter:</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#introduction">[introduction]</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>  This chapter covers a
  first look at the API through the command-line HTTP client called
  cURL. We talk a bit about the response format and how to parse it
  within the command line, and also document authentication. This is
  the only chapter that does not build an application from the
  technologies presented.
<a href="#chapter2">Gists and the Gist API</a>: This chapter covers the Gist API, as well as command-line
  tools and the Ruby language "Octokit" API client. We then take this
  API and build a simple Ruby server that is stored as a gist and
  displays gists.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#chapter3">GitHub Wikis with Gollum</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter explains usage of the Gollum command-line tool
and associated Ruby library (gem), which is backed by Grit, the
C-language bindings for accessing Git repositories. We also
document some details of the Git storage format and how it applies
to storing large files inside of a Git repository, and show how to
use the Git command-line tools to play with this information. We use
Gollum and the Grit libraries to build an image management tool
that also functions as a regular Gollum wiki, which can be published
to GitHub.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#python_search_api">[python_search_api]</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this chapter we explore the Search API and build a GUI
tool to search repositories on GitHub using Python.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#commit_status">[commit_status]</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>This chapter covers a relatively new part of
the API that documents the interactions between third-party tools
and your code. This chapter builds an application using C# and the
Nancy .NET GitHub API libraries.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#Jekyll">Ruby and Jekyll</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>If you push a specifically organized
repository into GitHub, GitHub will host a fully featured blog,
equivalent in most ways to a Wordpress site (well, except for the
complexity part). This chapter documents how to format your
repository, how to use Markdown within Jekyll, how to use
programmatic looping constructs provided by Liquid Templates, and
then shows how to import an entire website from the Internet
Archive into the Jekyll format using Ruby. We show
how to respectfully spider a site using caching, a valuable
technique when using APIs or third-party public information.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#android_and_git_data_api">Android and the Git Data API</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>In this chapter we create a mobile
application targeting the Android OS. Our application reads and
writes information into a Jekyll repository from the Git Data
section of the API. We show how to create user interface tests for
Android that verify GitHub API responses using the Calabash UI
testing tool.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#Hubot">CoffeeScript, Hubot, and the Activity API</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Hubot is a JavaScript (NodeJS) chat robot
enabling technologists to go beyond developer operations ("DevOps")
to a new frontier called "ChatOps." This chapter illustrates
using the Activity and Pull Requests section
of the API. In addition, we show how you can simulate GitHub
notifications and how to write testable Hubot extensions (which is
often a challenge when writing JavaScript code). We string all these
pieces together and build a robot that automates assigning pull
request review requests.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1"><a href="#JavaScript">JavaScript and the Git Data API</a></dt>
<dd>
<p>Did you know you can host an entire
"single-page application" on GitHub? We show how you can build a
coffee shop information app backed by a flat file database hosted on
GitHub written in the JavaScript language. Importantly, we show how
you can write a testable JavaScript application that mocks out the
GitHub API when needed.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t cover the Organizations API: this is a small facet of the API
with only the ability to list organizations and modify metadata about
your organization; once you have used other parts of the API this nook
of the API will be very intuitive.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also don&#8217;t cover the Users section of the API. While you might
expect it to be an important part of the API, the Users API is really
nothing more than an endpoint to list information about users, add or
remove SSH keys, adjust email addresses, and modify your list of
followers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is not a specific chapter on issues. GitHub originally
grouped issues and pull requests into the same API section, but with the
growing importance of pull requests GitHub has separated them in the
API documentation. In fact, they are still internally stored in the
same database and pull requests are, at least for now, just another
type of issue. <a href="#Hubot">CoffeeScript, Hubot, and the Activity API</a> documents using pull requests and
is a good reference for issues in that way.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Enterprise API works almost exactly the same as the GitHub.com
site API. We don&#8217;t have a chapter telling a story about an Enterprise
version of the API, but we do provide an <a href="#appendix">appendix</a> that contains a few
notes about how the examples work when using an Enterprise server. We also
provide the specific syntax for each of the languages used in the
chapters that will make any of the examples provided work with an
Enterprise server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Through these stories about the technologies behind GitHub we hope to
give you an inside look at the inner workings of the brain of a
developer building on top of the GitHub API.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_who_you_are">Who You Are</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book should be an interesting source of information for people
who have used Git or GitHub and want to "level-up" their skills
related to these technologies. People without any experience using
GitHub or Git should start with an introductory book on these
technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should have good familiarity with at least one imperative modern
programming language. You don&#8217;t need to be an expert programmer to
read this book, but having some programming experience and familiarity
with at least one language is essential.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should understand the basics of the HTTP protocol. The GitHub team
uses a very standard RESTful approach for its API. You should
understand the difference between a GET request and POST request and what
HTTP status codes mean at the very least.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Familiarity with other web APIs will make traversing these
chapters easier, although this book simultaneously aspires to provide
a guide showing how a well-thought-out, well-designed, and well-tested
web API creates a foundation for building fun and powerful tools. If
you have not used web APIs extensively, but have experience using
other types of APIs, you will be in good company.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_you_will_learn">What You Will Learn</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Much of the book focuses on the technical capabilities exposed by
GitHub and the powerful GitHub API. Perhaps you feel constrained by
using Git only from within a certain toolset; for example, if you are
an Android developer using Git to manage your app source code and want
to unlock Git in other places in your life as a developer, this book
provides a wider vista to learn about the power of Git and GitHub. If
you have fallen into using Git for your own projects and are now
interested in using Git within a larger community, this book can teach
you all about the "social coding" style
pioneered and dogfooded by the GitHub team. This book provides a
stepping stone for software developers who have used other distributed
version control systems and are looking for a bridge to using their
skills with Git and within a web service like GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like any seasoned developer, automation of your tools is important to
you. This book provides examples of mundane tasks converted into
automated and repeatable processes. We show how to do this using a
variety of languages talking to the GitHub API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make this book accessible to everyone, regardless of
their editor or operating system, many of the programming samples work
within the command line. If you are unfamiliar with the "command line"
this book will give you a firm understanding of how to use it, and we
bet you will find great power there. If you have hated the command
line since your father forced you to use it when you were five, this
is the perfect book to rekindle a loving relationship with the bash
shell.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you absorb not only the technical facets of using GitHub but also
pay attention to the cultural and ideological changes offered behind
the tools, you&#8217;ll very likely see a new way of working in the modern
age. We focus on these "meta" viewpoints as we discuss the tools
themselves to help you see these extra opportunities.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Almost every chapter has an associated repository hosted on GitHub
where you can review the code discussed. Fork away and take these
samples into your own projects and tools!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we help you write testable API-backed code. Even the most experienced
developers often find that writing tests for their code is a
challenge, despite the massive body of literature connecting quality
code with tests. Testing can be especially challenging when you are
testing something backed by an API; it requires a different level of
thinking than is found in strict unit testing. To help you get past
this roadblock, whenever possible, this book shows you how to write
code that interacts with the GitHub API and is testable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_github_first_class_languages">GitHub "First Class" Languages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two languages that are so fundamentally linked to GitHub
that you do need to install and use them in order to get the most out
of this book.</p>
</div>
<div class="dlist">
<dl>
<dt class="hdlist1">Ruby</dt>
<dd>
<p>A simple, readable programming language the founders of
GitHub used extensively early in the life of the company.</p>
</dd>
<dt class="hdlist1">JavaScript</dt>
<dd>
<p>The only ubiquitous browser-side programming language; its
importance has grown to new heights with the introduction of
NodeJS, rivaling even the popularity of Ruby on Rails as a server-side toolkit for web applications, especially for independent  developers.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Undoubtedly, many of you picking up this book already have familiarity
with Ruby or JavaScript/NodeJS. So, the basics and installation of them are in
appendices in the back of the book. The appendices don&#8217;t cover syntax
of these languages; we expect you have experience with other languages
as a prerequisite and can read code from any imperative language
regardless of the syntax. Later chapters discuss facets of the API and
go into language details at times, but the code is readable regardless
of your familiarity with that particular language. These
explanatory appendices discuss the history of these tools within the
GitHub story as well as important usage notes like special files and
installation options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your time will not be wasted if you install and play with these two
tools. Between them you will have a solid toolset to begin
exploration of the GitHub API. Several chapters in this book use Ruby
or JavaScript, so putting in some time to learn at least a little bit will
make the journey through this book richer for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_operating_system_prerequisites">Operating System Prerequisites</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We, the authors, wrote this book using MacBook Pros. MacBooks have a
ubiquitous shell ("BASH") that works almost identically to the one
found on any Linux machine. If you use either of these two operating
systems, you will be able to run the code from any chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you use a Windows machine (or an OS that does not include the BASH
shell) then some of the commands and code examples may not work
without installing additional software.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An easy remedy is to use VirtualBox and Vagrant. VirtualBox is a
freely available virtualization system for x86 hardware. Vagrant is a
tool for managing development environments: using VirtualBox and
Vagrant you can quickly install a Linux virtual machine. To do this,
visit the downloads page for
<a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a> and
<a href="https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html">Vagrant</a>. Once you have
installed these two tools, you can then install an Ubuntu Linux
virtual machine with these two commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ vagrant init hashicorp/precise32
$ vagrant up</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_who_this_book_is_not_for">Who This Book Is Not For</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are looking for a discussion of the GitHub API that focuses on
a single language, you should know that we look at the API through
many different languages. We do this to describe the API from not only
the way the GitHub team designed it to work, but the aspirational way
that client library authors made it work within
diverse programming languages and communities. We think there is a lot
to learn from this approach, but if you are interested in only a
specific language and how it works with the GitHub API, this is not
the book for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book strives to prove that API-driven code is testable and that
there is a benefit to doing so. This book does not intend to provide a
manual on how to write perfectly tested code. We cover too many
languages to end the healthy debates happening within each community
about the right test frameworks. Instead, given our contention that most
software projects have zero test coverage, this book tries to help
you get past this significant roadblock. There is something
transformational about writing tests if you have never done so
before. Having these examples in hand, we hope, will allow you to
transition to writing testable code for APIs, especially if you have
not done so before. Some of the associated repositories have much
greater test suites than are documented in this book, but we don&#8217;t
cover all the entire set of edge cases in every situation.</p>

<p>Chris wants to thank his lovely wife, Nicole. I hope that I have added
to this book even a tiny bit of the wit and wisdom you provide to me
and our family every day. My son Roosevelt&#8217;s energy continues to
inspire me and keep me going even when I am at my limits. To my
daughter Charlotte, you are my little smiling Buddha. To my mother,
who showed me how to write and, most importantly, why to write, which
is something we need more of in the technology world. To Tim O&#8217;Brien
who invited me into this project, thank you, and I hope we can
collaborate again. To Bradley Horowitz, who demonstrates how small
acts of kindness can have immeasurable impact. And, to David J. Groom,
though we have never met face to face, your suggestions and excitement
about the book early on came at a critical moment in the life of this
book, and I thank you for channeling the excitement I hoped to
cultivate with people who would one day pick up this book.</p>

<h2 id="chapter2">Gists and the Gist API</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub revolutionized software development by responding to a deep
desire to share information. But calling it just "sharing" does a disservice to
the tools GitHub provides: these tools remove barriers to
communication and streamline workflows. These tools also arose at
exactly the moment when the information technology revolution forced
companies to adopt more open technologies that assisted an emerging remote
workforce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gists service part of this need: they permit intimate code
sharing and reuse, refactoring, and experimentation in a way not served by the
heavyweight tools predating it. In this chapter we will explore using
gists to share code, and then build an application hosted as a
gist that uses the Gist API.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_easy_code_sharing">Easy Code Sharing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gists are straightforward to create. You copy a snippet
of code into the large text box in the center, optionally enter in a
description or filename, and then choose between a public or private
gist. Once your gist has been created you are presented with a URL to
share. Gists autodetect the language in most cases and syntax
highlight according to the language when displayed as in <a href="#documenting_json_using_a_gist">Documenting JSON using a gist</a>.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 1. Documenting JSON using a gist</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are other services that do this: pastebin was the first, and
there are many others that offer variances on code sharing. But gists
by GitHub are not simply a pasting service. Gists are first-class
repositories, forkable, editable, and expansive. We&#8217;ll go over the basics
of what gists are, and how to create them, and then show how they
allow you to share code that is also a live application.</p>

created is a tiny repository. You can update gists and see
the history using <code>git log</code>. You can download gists, hack on the
repository, and <code>git push</code> them back into the repository on
<em>gist.github.com</em> (which will republish them onto the publicly
facing web page). And, you can "fork" gists, just like
any other repository.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You are allowed to branch within gist repositories; however, branches
are not displayed inside of <em>gist.github.com/</em>. But if you need the

inside a repository and the branch information is retained on the
upstream repository after you push it up.</p>

<p>You can have an unlimited number of public and secret gists. Secret gists can, in many cases, replace private repositories, and these secret gists don&#8217;t count against the limited amount of private repositories you have with paid GitHub accounts. Or, you can make a gist public, and
share that URL to mailing lists or anywhere you need public feedback.</p>

<p>Jekyll blogs (explained in <a href="#Jekyll">Ruby and Jekyll</a>) can easily host
gists using a special syntax. The shortcut <code>{% gist 8138797 %}</code> will
embed a private gist, which would be found at
<em><a href="http://gist.github.com/8138797" class="bare">http://gist.github.com/8138797</a></em>.  If you want to use a
specific file within the gist, add a filename to the gist code like
<code>{% gist 8138797 hi.rb %}</code>. Secret gists can also be embedded. If you
use a secret gist, prefix the username of the account holder in the
gist like so: <code>{% gist xrd/8138797 hi.rb %}</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s look at creating gists from outside the GitHub.com site,
using the command-line.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_gist_from_the_command_line">Gist from the Command Line</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>gem install gist</code> will install a command line tool that helps create gists. You can use it simply by typing the command, and then
entering the data you want to post as a gist:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ gist
(type a gist. &lt;ctrl-c&gt; to cancel, &lt;ctrl-d&gt; when done)
{ "foo" : "bar" }
https://gist.github.com/9106765</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The gist command will return the link to the gist just created. Gists
are created anonymously by default. You can log in using the <code>--login</code>
switch. Once you do this, your gists will be linked to
your account:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ gist --login
Obtaining OAuth2 access_token from github.
GitHub username: xrd
GitHub password:
2-factor auth code: 787878

Success! https://github.com/settings/applications</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can pipe text to the gist command to use the contents of that
file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ echo '{ "foo" : "bar" }' | gist
https://gist.github.com/9106799</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also <code>cat</code> a file to gist:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cat MyJavaFile.java | gist
https://gist.github.com/9345609</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gists are often used to show interesting or troublesome code, and there
are times when you don&#8217;t want to display the entirety of a file. In
this case the command-line <code>grep</code> tool can be useful; <code>grep</code> searches
for a specific piece of code and with the right switches can include
several lines of context around that code inside a gist. This command
looks for the function <code>myFunction</code> inside the <em>MyJavaFile.java</em> file
and then prints the next 20 lines of context and stores it as a gist:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ grep -A 20 myFunction MyJavaFile.java | gist
https://gist.github.com/9453069</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding the <code>-o</code> switch automatically opens the gist inside your
default web browser. You can also copy the gist URL to the clipboard
using the <code>-c</code> switch. Or, you can copy the contents of your clipboard
into a gist using the <code>-P</code> switch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many other fun features of the gist command. To learn more
run the gist command with the <code>--help</code> switch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As gists are themselves repositories, you can use them for dual
purposes: for hosting code samples, and for code samples that are themselves
fully working and packaged applications inside a gist repository.</p>

<h3 id="_gists_as_fully_functioning_apps">Gists as Fully Functioning Apps</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s build a simple Sinatra application to showcase how code hosted
as a gist can also be a living application. Sinatra is a Ruby library
for creating dead-simple web servers. A Sinatra program can be as
simple as this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">require 'sinatra'

get '/hi' do
  "Hello World!"

<p>Create a gist for this by visiting <a class="orm:hideurl" href="https://gist.github.com/"><em>gist.github.com</em></a>. Enter in the text exactly as shown and then choose
public gist.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You now have a share-friendly gist of code anyone can use to review.
More importantly, this is a repository with executable code. To clone
it, look for the Clone URL to the right of the gist itself. You will
likely see a Git protocol URL and an HTTPS URL. If you are cloning
the URL and intend only to read the gist, you can use the HTTPS
URL. You technically can push changes once you have cloned a
repository using the HTTPS URL but not if you have two-factor
authentication enabled. In most cases it is easier and more flexible
to use the Git protocol URL.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s clone it now:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git clone git@gist.github.com:8138797.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have cloned the repository, go inside it. You&#8217;ll see a list
of files, a list that right now includes only one file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ cd 8138797
$ ls
hi.rb</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This code is exectuable: to run it enter <code>ruby hi.rb</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have not used Sinatra with Ruby before, this will cause an
error. This program requires a library called "sinatra" and
you have not yet installed it. We could write a read me file, or add
documentation into this file itself. Another
way to guarantee the user has the proper files installed is to use a
<em>Gemfile</em>, which is a file that tells
which libraries are installed and from where. That sounds like the
best way:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ printf "source 'https://rubygems.org'\ngem 'sinatra'" &gt; Gemfile</code></pre>

<p>The <code>bundle</code> command (from the bundler gem) will install Sinatra and
the associated dependencies:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Why did we do things this way? Because now we can add the Gemfile to
our repository locally, and then publish into our gist for sharing on
the Web. Our repository now not only has the code, but a well-known
manifest file that explains the necessary components when running the
code.</p>

<h4 id="_going_deeper_into_the_gist_api">Going Deeper into the Gist API</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub API uses hypermedia instead of
basic resource-driven APIs. If you use a client like Octokit, the
hypermedia details are hidden behind an elegant Ruby client. But
there is a benefit to understanding how hypermedia works when you need
to retrieve deeper information from the GitHub API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most RESTful APIs come with a "sitemap," generally an API reference
document that tells a user which endpoints to use. You view
the resources available from that API and then apply some HTTP verb to
do something to them. Hypermedia thinks of an API differently.
Hypermedia APIs describe themselves inside their responses using
"affordances." What this means is that the API might respond like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-json" data-lang="json">{
    "_links": {
        "self": {
            "href": "http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030300.do"
        }
    }
    "id": "xrd",
    "name": "Chris Dawson"
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this payload, you can see that there is an id ("xrd") and a name
("Chris Dawson"). This particular payload was forked from the HAL explanation at the
<a href="http://bit.ly/1SGLDw3">HAL
Primer document</a>, and you can find a more detailed explanation of these concepts
there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The important thing to note about hypermedia APIs is that payloads contain
metadata about data itself and metadata about the possible options of
operating on the data. RESTful APIs typically provide a mapping
outside of the payload. You have to join the API sitemap with the data
in an ad hoc way when using RESTful APIs; with hypermedia APIs your
client can react to the payload itself correctly and intelligently
without knowing anything about a sitemap stored in human-readable
documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This loose coupling makes APIs and their clients flexible. In theory,
a hypermedia API works intuitively with a hypermedia-aware client. If
you change the API, the client, as it understands hypermedia, can
react and still work as expected. Using a RESTful API means that
clients must be updated (a newer version of the client must be
installed) or the client code must be upgraded. Hypermedia APIs can
alter their backend, and then the client, as long as it is
hypermedia-aware, can automatically and dynamically determine
the right way to access information from the response itself. In other
words, with a hypermedia client the API backend can change and your
client code should not need to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is explained in great detail in the book <a class="orm:hideurl" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920020530.do"><em>Building

In this case, you could call a method like <code>user.followers</code> to see a
meager follower count.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>user</code> also has hypermedia references. You can see these by calling
<code>user.rels</code>. This retrieves the relationships described in the
hypermedia links.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Relationships (found by calling <code>user.rels</code>) include avatar, self,
followers, etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use a relationship by calling the <code>get.data</code> method to retrieve and
access the data from the GitHub API (<code>followers =
user.rels[:followers].get.data</code>).</p>

projects (code repositories) because they allow nontechnical
users to contribute in ways other than adding code. Gollum
is an open source wiki created by GitHub. Just as Git has
revolutionized collaborative editing of code, Gollum wikis layer the
benefits of Git onto the widely used wiki publishing workflow. Gollum
wikis are themselves repositories that generally annotate other
typically code-centric repositories. GitHub makes it easy to associate
a wiki with any
repository.</p>

<p>In this chapter we&#8217;ll explore the basics of using Gollum, creating a
wiki on GitHub and then learning how to edit it on GitHub and as
a repository on our local machine. We will then create a Gollum wiki by
hand from the command line, and show the bare minimum set of files to
call something a Gollum repository. Finally, we will build a simple
image organization tool that allows us to edit a Gollum wiki in an
entirely different way, but still publishes information into GitHub as
a regular Gollum wiki, exploring a little bit of the internals of Git

<p>Gollum files can be written in any of the supported "Github Markup" formats, which
include ASCIIdoc, Creole, Markdown, Org Mode, Pod, RDoc,
ReStructuredText, Textile, and MediaWiki. The variety of markup
languages brings flexibility but it can be difficult to know which one
to use. Markdown (and its variant cousins) is the most popular markup
language on GitHub, and is well liked on other popular sites like
Stack Overflow. If you are unsure about which language to use, Markdown is a
safe bet because it is ubiquitous across GitHub. <a href="#Jekyll">Ruby and Jekyll</a> has a much deeper overview of Markdown.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph pagebreak-before">
<p>If you do choose Markdown, in addition to the standard vanilla
Markdown language tags, Gollum adds its own set of wiki-specific tags. There
are often subtle (or conflicting) differences from other wiki markup
so it is worth reviewing the
<a href="https://github.com/gollum/gollum/wiki">Gollum repository documentation

<p>Links obviously convert into the <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> HTML tag. Each format has its

<p>Gollum (the wiki) was invented at GitHub, a company dedicated to
improving the lives of software developers, so it stands to reason
Gollum wikis would support insertion of code snippets. To include a snippet of
code, use three backticks, followed by an optional language name, and close
the block of code using three more backticks. If you use the language
name, Gollum will do proper syntax highlighting for most languages:</p>

named <em>ceo.png</em> inside your page. This basic syntax is often extended
for additional funtionality. For example, to add a frame
and an alt tag, you could use syntax like <code>[[ceo.png|frame|alt=Our CEO
relaxing on the beach]]</code>. This creates the proper HTML tags for the
same image, and also adds a frame and alt text (helpful for better
context and the extra information is used by screenreaders for
visually impaired users as well).  Review the documentation on the
Gollum repository for more details about the breadth of the image
options.</p>

<h3 id="_hacking_gollum">Hacking Gollum</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Would an image editor based on Gollum be of general use? On many
software teams there is tension between the design
team and the software team stemming from the fact that designers
generally don&#8217;t like using source-code tools to manage images. This
causes issues when software developers rely on designs that are
rapidly changing: coders quickly get out of sync with the latest
designs. As a wiki, Gollum is the perfect tool to bridge this gap
between designers and coders: wikis are easy to read and modify by
nontechnical users. Since Gollum is a hackable wiki, we can build our
own workflow tool that allows designers to manage images and coders to
easily see those changes in a source-code repository.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will be a dual-purpose repository. We can use the repository with
Gollum as a standard wiki, and we can use it with our application to

hosted on GitHub.</p>

<h3 id="_using_the_rugged_library">Using the Rugged Library</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our end goal for this script is to add files to our Gollum wiki, which
means adding files to the repository that backs our Gollum wiki.
The Rugged library handles the grunt work of this type of task easily.
Rugged is the successor to the original Ruby library for Git (called
Grit). Gollum, at the time of writing, uses the Grit libraries,
which also provide a binding to the libgit2 library, a "portable, pure
C implementation of the Git core methods." Grit has been abandoned
(though there are unofficial maintainers) and the Gollum team intends
to use Rugged as the long-term library backing Gollum. Rugged is
written in Ruby and (provided you like Ruby) is a more
elegant way to interface with a Git repository than raw Git
commands. As you might expect, Rugged is maintained by several employees of GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To change our script to modify our Git repository, let&#8217;s change our
script to no longer print the filename (using the <code>puts</code> method inside
the ZIP decode block) and instead call a new method called
<code>write_file_to_repo</code>. And, at the end of the ZIP block, add a method
called <code>build_commit</code>, which builds the commit from our new files. Our
new file (omitting the unchanged code at the head of the file) looks
like this:</p>

      if contents and filename and filename =~ /(png|jp?g|gif)$/i

    end
    build_commit() # Build a commit from the new files

  index( params[:zip][:filename] )

  Rugged::Commit.create(@repo, options)

end

def write_file_to_repo( contents, filename )
  oid = @repo.write( contents, :blob )

end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see from the code, Rugged handles a lot of the grunt
work required when creating a commit inside a Git repository. Rugged has a
simple interface to creating a blob inside your Git repository
(<code>write</code>), and adding files to the index (the <code>add</code> method), and
also has a simple and clean interface to build the tree object
(<code>write_tree</code>) and then build the commit (<code>Rugged::Commit.create</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To ease the burden of hardcoding our commit credentials, we implement
a method called <code>get_credentials</code> that loads up your credentials from a file called <em>.gitconfig</em> located in your home directory. You
probably have this if you have used Git for anything at all on your machine, but if this
file is missing, this method will fail. On my machine this file looks
like the following code snippet. The <code>get_credentials</code> method simply loads up this
file and parses it for the name and email address. If you wanted to
load the credentials using another method, or even hardcode them, you
can just modify this method to suit your needs. The instance variables
<code>@email</code> and <code>@name</code> are then used in the <code>build_commit()</code> method:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We just added those files; why is Git reporting them as deleted?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To understand why this happens, remember that in Git there are three
places files can reside: the working directory, the staging
area or index, and the repository itself. Your working directory is
the set of local files you are working on. The <code>git status</code>
command describes itself as "show the working tree status." Rugged
operates on the repository itself, and the Rugged calls in the preceding code operated
on the index and then built a commit. This is important to note
because our files will not exist in our working directory if we only
write them using the Rugged calls, and if we do this, we cannot
reference them inside our wiki page when we are running Gollum
locally. We&#8217;ll fix this in the next section.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve now added the files to our repository, but we have not exposed
these files inside our wiki. Let&#8217;s modify our server script to write
out each file to a wiki page for review. As we mentioned in the
previous section, we need to make sure we write the files to both
the working index and the repository (using the Rugged library <code>write</code>
call). Then we can generate a Review file that details all the images
uploaded.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_adding_images_to_a_review_file">Adding Images to a Review File</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have successfully unzipped and processed the images, we can add them to a file
for review. We will call this file <code>Review.md</code>. The code to write the
review file looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def write_review_file( files, dir )
   review_filename = "Review.md"
   contents = "## Review Images\n\n"
   files.each do |f|
      contents += "### #{f} \n[[#{dir}/#{f}]]\n\n"
   end

  File.write review_filename, contents
  oid = @repo.write( contents, :blob )
  @index.add(:path =&gt; review_filename, :oid =&gt; oid, :mode =&gt; 0100644)
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The method is straightforward: we pass in the list of files and a
subdirectory where we wrote out the image files to disk. Then, we generate
a Markdown file with a header (using the two hash formatting characters) stating
"Review Images," and then iterate over the list of images, entering the filename
as a subheader. We then use the Gollum image markup tag (two braces, then the image
filename, then closing with two more braces). We write out the file to disk. Finally, we add the file to the repository and then to the index. The commit that
we built for the images will include this review file as well, since it is added to the index
before the images are processed—as long as we place the call to <code>write_review_file</code> before the
call to <code>build_commit</code> like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"> ...
  write_review_file files, dir # write out a review file
  build_commit() # Build a commit from the new files

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, let&#8217;s take a look at how images are stored inside our repository, particularly if the same image
is uploaded twice.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_optimizing_for_image_storage">Optimizing for Image Storage</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a designer uploads the same image twice, what happens? Our code
writes the uploaded image to a path on disk that is based on
the parent SHA hash of the repository (and this means we will always
write the file to a different path, even when the file is the same as
a previous uploaded file). It would look to
an untrained eye like we are adding the file multiple times.
However, the nature of Git permits us to add the same file
multiple times without incurring any additional storage cost beyond
the first addition (and the minimal cost of a tree structure). When a file is added to a Git repository, an SHA hash
is generated from the file contents. For example, generating the SHA hash
from an empty file will always return the same SHA hash:<span class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_2" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_2" title="View footnote.">2</a>]</span></p>

an interface for reviewing the statistics of wikis in the same way
they do for regular repositories. We can, however, review our
repository size from within the local repository by running the
count-objects Git subcommand. As an example, I uploaded a ZIP file
with two images inside of it. I then use the
count-objects command and see this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inspecting the first ZIP file, I see these statistics about it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s use another ZIP file with the same two files present but
with an additional image file added:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, I upload the second ZIP file. If I rerun the count-objects

<p>Notice that our packed size has only changed by about half a MB, which
is the compressed size of the additional third file, but more

repository size, even though they were added at different paths.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we upload the secondary file yet again, we will regenerate and
commit a new version of the <em>Review.md</em> file, but no new files will
need to be created inside our Git repository object store from the

<p>As you can see, our packed size has barely changed, an indication that

<p>The raison d&#8217;etre for this wiki is to annotate a development project.
If you follow the instructions and create a new wiki for a
repository, you&#8217;ll then be able to push up the changes we&#8217;ve made
using our image.rb script. Once you have created a new wiki, look
for a box on the right that says "Clone this wiki locally," as seen in <a href="#gollum_git_clone_url">Getting the clone URL for our wiki</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="gollum_git_clone_url" class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 8. Getting the clone URL for our wiki</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Copy that link, and then enter a terminal window where we can then add a remote
URL to our local repository that allows us to synchronize our
repositories and publish our images into GitHub. Gollum wikis have a
simple URL structure based on the original clone URL: just add the
word <code>.wiki</code> to the end of the clone URL (but before the final <code>.git</code>
extension). So, if the original clone URL of the repository is
<code>git@github.com:xrd/webiphany.com.git</code> our clone URL for the
associated wiki will be <code>git@github.com:xrd/webiphany.com.wiki.git</code>.
Once we have the URL, we can add it as a remote to our local
repository using the following commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ git remote add origin git@github.com:xrd/webiphany.com.wiki.git
$ git pull # This will require us to merge the changes...
$ git push</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we pull, we will be asked to merge our changes since GitHub
created a <em>Home.md</em> file that did not exist in our local repository.
We can just accept the merge as is. The <code>git push</code> publishes our
changes. If we then visit the wiki, we&#8217;ll see an additional file
listed under the pages sidebar to the right. Clicking the Review
page, as in <a href="#images_displayed_within_a_gollum_wiki">An image review page</a>, we can see the images we&#8217;ve added most recently.</p>

<p>Once we have published the file, we can click the Review link in the
sidebar to see the most current version of the Review page. We also
can review the revisions of this file by clicking the "3 Commits"
(or whatever number of commits have occurred with this file)
link right underneath the page title. Jumping onto that page shows us
the full history of this file, as shown in <a href="#a_view_on_the_revisions_from_within_github">Wiki history review via the Commit Log</a>.</p>

<p>Clicking any of the SHA hashes will display the page at that
revision in our history and show us the state of the document at any given
moment in history. Unfortunately, jumping back and forth between
revisions requires two clicks, one from the Review page to the list of
revisions, and then another click to jump into the revision we want,
but this permits us to review changes between the comps provided from
our designer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It would be nice if GitHub provided a simple way to jump
from a revision to the parent (older) revision, but it doesn&#8217;t expose
this in its site at this point. We can fix this, however, by generating
our own special link inside the Review page itself, which will
magically know how to navigate to a previous version of the page.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_improving_revision_navigation">Improving Revision Navigation</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In our example, we only have three revisions right now, and all share the same commit
message ("Adding new images"). This is not very descriptive and makes
it challenging to understand the differences between revisions, which is
critical when we are trying to understand how things have changed
between comps. We can improve this easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let&#8217;s add a commit message field to our upload form:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;!-- message --&gt;
&lt;form method='POST' enctype='multipart/form-data' action='/unpack'&gt;
Choose a zip file:
&lt;input type='file' name='zip'/&gt;
&lt;input type='text' name='message' placeholder='Enter commit message'/&gt;
&lt;input type='submit' name='submit'&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, let&#8217;s adjust the commit message inside our <em>image.rb</em> script,
which is a one-line change to the options hash, setting the value of
it to the parameter we are now passing in for commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  ...
options[:committer] = { :email =&gt; @email, :name =&gt; @name, :time =&gt; Time.now }
options[:message] = params[:message]
options[:parents] = @repo.empty? ? [] : [ @repo.head.target ].compact
  ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if our designer posts a new version of the UI comps, they can
specify what changes were made, and we have a record of that in our
change log, which is exposed on the revisions section of our wiki hosted on GitHub.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_fixing_linking_between_comp_pages">Fixing Linking Between Comp Pages</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As noted, there is no quick way to jump between comps once we are
inside a review revision. However, if you recall we used the parent
SHA hash to build out our image links. We can use this to build out a
navigation links inside our comp page when we are on a revision page while
viewing the history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, it is a simple change: one line within the <code>write_review_file</code>
method. After the block that creates each link to the image files,
add a line that builds a link to the parent document
via its SHA hash using the parent SHA found in our Rugged object under
<code>@repo.head.target</code>. This link will allow us to navigate to prior
revisions in our history:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">  ...
files.each do |f|
  contents += "### #{f} \n[[#{dir}/#{f}]]\n\n"
end
contents += "[Prior revision (only when viewing history)]" +
"(#{@repo.head.target})\n\n"

File.write review_filename, contents
oid = @repo.write( contents, :blob )
@index.add(:path =&gt; review_filename, :oid =&gt; oid, :mode =&gt; 0100644)
  ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, when we view the Review file history, we see a link to each prior
version. Is it possible to provide a link to the next version in our
history? Unfortunately, we have no way to predict the SHA hash of the
next commit made to the repository, so we cannot build this link
inside our <em>Review.md</em> file with our Ruby script. However, we do get
something just as good for free because we can simply use the back
button to jump back to the prior page in the history stack of our
browser. We might try to get clever
and use a link with JavaScript to call window.history.back() but
Gollum will foil this attempt by stripping JavaScript from rendered
markup files. This is generally a good thing, as we don&#8217;t want to
permit rogue markup inside our wiki pages, but it does limit our
options in this situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, these links do not work when you are viewing the review file itself
(clicking them brings you to a page that asks you to create this
as a new page). Gollum, unlike Jekyll, does not support Liquid
tags, which would permit building a link using the username and
repository. Right now we don&#8217;t have access to these variables, so our
link needs to be relative, which works when we are in history review,
but not in the normal review. It does not affect viewing the files so
this would require educating your stakeholders on the limitations of
this link.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_summary_2">Summary</h3>

<p>In this chapter we learned how to create a Gollum wiki from
scratch, both on GitHub and as a fresh repository from the command
line. We then looked at the different ways to use the Gollum command-line tool and learned why this is a nice option when we want to run
our own Gollum server. Finally, we built a customized Gollum
image-centric editor using the Rugged and Sinatra Ruby libraries.</p>

<h2 id="JavaScript">JavaScript and the Git Data API</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Applications utilizing the GitHub API will typically reside inside a
server. You are not limited, however, to accessing
the API from within server-side programming languages exclusively.
The GitHub API works perfectly well from within a web browser context
as well, and the UI to your application comes for free if you know a
little HTML. In this chapter we discuss how to use the unofficial
JavaScript client library to access the GitHub API and build a single-page application (SPA), which we host entirely on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main weakness of JavaScript has always been testability. Mainly
due to the asynchronous nature of JavaScript, writing tests has never
been easy; polling for changes when a callback returns was until
recently the best way to test nonlinear code. But recent
toolkits like AngularJS and promise-based libraries have made testing
not only easy, but elegant as well. Building applications on top of
third-party services makes testing even more important than it already
was, and we&#8217;ll make sure to add testing to our application to verify
the functionality works as we expect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JavaScript should be generally accessible to most people who know other
imperative programming languages. There is one feature, however, that
can be challenging: the callback function. In JavaScript, functions
are first-class objects, meaning they can be passed as arguments to
other functions and stored as the value of a variable. You will find
callbacks everywhere in JavaScript programming. Callbacks make
debugging and understanding JavaScript code more challenging at
times. As we stated earlier, writing code that includes tests makes
understanding the entire picture easier, and we will do that in this
chapter to further explain sections where necessary function callbacks
may initially look confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_building_a_coffee_shop_database_on_github">Building a Coffee Shop Database on GitHub</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many software developers, I suffer from an almost disturbing
obsession with coffee. Perhaps it is really my family that suffers:
when we travel to a new city, I drag my wife and children through
questionable neighborhoods just to find the perfect brew and
complementary gluten-free desserts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Google Maps is a great help on these quests, in that it will find me a
coffee shop and reviews, but the granularity of information about that
coffee shop is often poor and limited in scope. Do they offer rice
milk as a dairy-free alternative?  What special details should I know
when considering a place? Many guidance and mapping applications
exist, but if they don&#8217;t fit my own personalized informational niche,
I might miss a unique experience. With such a pressing and dire
problem in front of us, let&#8217;s use the GitHub API to solve it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll build a coffee shop single-page web app that allows anyone to add
information on coffee shops, information that is flexible and
dynamic, and search and filter through that information about a coffee
shop. All files, such as the HTML, images, and JavaScript will be
hosted on GitHub. And we&#8217;ll be using the GitHub API to allow
contributors to add data to our database, a database we will
also host on GitHub. And as GitHub developers write code with tests,
we will write tests to validate our JavaScript code as well as the
expectations we have of the GitHub API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>More specifically, we&#8217;ll use these technologies:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/michael/github">An (unofficial) GitHub API JavaScript library</a></p>

<h3 id="_set_up">Set Up</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create our app, let&#8217;s first create our main web page and push it into our repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ mkdir coffeete.ch

$ git commit -m "Add starting point index.html" -a
$ git config push.default gh-pages</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that we created a new repository, and then created and entered
the gh-pages branch. We&#8217;ll do all our work there. And by using the
git config command, we specified that we want the default push branch
to be gh-pages. This allows us to use <code>git push</code> to push our branch up
instead of the longer <code>git push origin gh-pages</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mapping_hostnames">Mapping Hostnames</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once we publish these files into GitHub inside a repository we can connect the repository to a
real hostname. There are two steps to take to do this:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Add a CNAME file that tells GitHub under which server name this service should resolve.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Set up DNS records so that the hostname maps to the correct IP
address at GitHub.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Imagine you have the hostname <em>myspecialhostname.com</em>. If you map this
repository to a subdomain called <em>coffeetech</em>, then you would do
something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ echo 'coffeetech.myspecialhostname.com' &gt; CNAME
$ git commit -m "Added CNAME mapping" -a
$ git push</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that you need to wait about 10 minutes before GitHub
regenerates its database to establish the connection between your
gh-pages site and the mapping on their frontend servers. This is only
the first time you connect a repository to a hostname; you will see
subsequent changes almost instantaneously.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I am assuming you have a firm grasp on most HTML concepts, but a few
of the advanced topics are included here:</p>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>The <code>meta</code> tag makes our page work well with mobile browsers and
enables the responsive features of Bootstrap.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>ng-app</code> attribute in the body tag tells AngularJS to initialize
and compile our page from the body tag downward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>{{ }}</code> (double brackets) are an AngularJS two-way data binding
directive. You&#8217;ll see two-way data binding in action very soon if it
is not already familiar. Adding this code here sanity checks whether
AngularJS is working for us; if we see "Welcome to Coffeete.ch"
without the braces then we know AngularJS is loading and working
properly. If we see the braces, then there is some error in our
setup to resolve. Two-way data binding solves a significant pain point when building JS apps:
marshalling data back and forth between network events, into HTML
and out of HTML forms. AngularJS does all this heavy lifting for
you. In a moment we&#8217;ll show how to use two-way data binding as it was
intended by defining a variable on the AngularJS scope. We then
access the variable using the same <code>{{ }}</code> data binding directives.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>Now let&#8217;s implement a <em>coffeetech.js</em> file, which is where we will
build our single-page application functionality. Create a new file called

<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Define a module named "coffeetech." Save a reference to the
module we will use next in defining a controller, a smaller
bundle of functions. Modules are an AngularJS feature for grouping
related functionality, and we will keep all our code for this
application inside this module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We define a controller called <code>GithubCtrl</code> that bundles up
functions and data. When we use the controller syntax, we name the
controller, and then define a function with at least a single
parameter: the scope object. I think of scope as the "world" available
to the controller. The controller knows only of data and functions
defined on its scope, and AngularJS does its magic as long as your
functions or variables are defined on the scope.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We create a new <code>Github()</code> object using the constructor. This
constructor can take user credentials, but for now, we can just
create it without those since we are accessing a public repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we have our <code>github</code> object, we call the method <code>getRepo()</code>
with an owner and a name. This returns our repository object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To actually load the data for this repository object, we call the <code>show</code>
method and pass it a callback that uses the two parameters <code>err</code>
and <code>repo</code> to handle errors or otherwise provide us with details of
the repository specified. In this case we are using the Gollum wiki
public repository to display some sample data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we have loaded the repository data, we need to call <code>$apply</code>
to tell AngularJS a change has occurred to data stored within the
scope variable. As we mentioned before, AngularJS knows only about
functions and data defined on its scope. The <code>show</code> function is
defined on the GitHub object, and any changes are not tracked by
AngularJS, so we need to use <code>$apply()</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub.js handles making the proper request to GitHub for us, and
AngularJS handles putting the results into our web page. To modify our
HTML to use this data, we change <em>index.html</em> to look like the following:</p>

<h4 id="_visualize_application_data_structure">Visualize Application Data Structure</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are going to be building a coffee shop database. We want to use Git
as our datastore, but Git and its associated tools (either command-line tools or GitHub) don&#8217;t offer the same features as
a standard relational database. So, we need to think and plan how we
will structure our data inside our repository to make it easily searchable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This application allows us to search coffee shops. These coffee shops
will be, for the most part, in larger cities. If we keep all the data
stored as JSON files named after the city, we can keep data located in
a file named after the city, and then either use geolocation on the
client side to retrieve a set of the data, or ask the user to choose
their city manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we look at the <a href="https://github.com/michael/github">GitHub.js JavaScript documentation on GitHub</a>
we can see that there are some
options for us to pull content from a repository. We&#8217;ll store a data
file in JSON named after the city inside our repository and retrieve
this from that repository. It looks like the calls we need to use are
<code>github.getRepo( username, reponame )</code>, and once we have retrieved the
repository, <code>repo.contents( branch, path, callback )</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have a barebones application let&#8217;s pause and make sure we
are building something we can refactor and maintain long term. This
means adding tests to our project.</p>

<p>Testing not only builds better code by making us think

Testing facilitates "social coding."</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll use a JavaScript testing tool called "Karma." Karma simplifies
writing JavaScript unit tests. We need to first install the tool, then
write a test or two. Karma can easily be installed using npm
(installation of which is documented in <a href="#appendix">[appendix]</a>):</p>

<p>The <code>files</code> section specifying the load order of our JavaScript
implementations and the test scripts. You can see a few of the files we&#8217;ve
added specified directly and wildcards to cover the remaining
files.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Note also that we&#8217;ve specified Chrome as our test browser (so
you should have it installed), which is a safe bet because it works on
just about any desktop platform you might be running. Know that
you can always choose Safari or Firefox if you want Karma to test
inside those as well. Karma will start a new instance of each browser
specified and run your tests inside a test harness in those browsers.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To write the test, let&#8217;s clarify what we want our code to do:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>When a user first visits the application, we should use the
geolocation features of their browser to determine their location.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull a file from our repository that contains general latitude and
longitude locations of different cities.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Iterate over the list of cities and see if we are within 25 miles of
any of the cities. If so, set the current city to the first match.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we found a city, load the JSON data file from GitHub.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Concretely, let&#8217;s assert that we load the list of cities and have two
of them, then we load a matching city named "Portland," a city that
has three shops available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll use an <code>ng-init</code> directive, which is the mechanism to tell
AngularJS we want to call the function specified when the controller
has finished loading. We&#8217;ll call this function <code>init</code> so let&#8217;s test it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we will write the setup code for an AngularJS test written
using the Jasmine test framework. Jasmine is a "behavior-driven
JavaScript" library that provides functions to group and create
expectation-based tests. Within the Jasmine framework are "matchers"
that allow for the most common assertions (comparing a variety of
expected types to the resultant types from function calls) and the
ability to define your own custom matchers. Jasmine also gives you the
ability to "spy" on functions, which is another way of saying Jasmine
can intercept function calls to validate that those calls were made in
the way you anticipate. It is easiest to explain the power of Jasmine
by showing the elegance of the tests themselves, so let&#8217;s do that now:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">describe( "GithubCtrl", function() {

         { $scope: scope, Github: gh, Geo: geo } ); <b class="conum">(6)</b>
        } )
    );
...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>We declare our variables at the top of the function. If we did not
do this, JavaScript would silently define them inside the functions
the first time the variable is used. Then our variables would be
different inside our setup code and the actual tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We load our <code>coffeetech</code> module into our tests using the <code>module</code>
method inside a <code>beforeEach</code> call, code that is executed before our
tests run.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>inject</code> is the AngularJS way to provide our before functions with
the <code><span class="keep-together">$controller</span></code> and <code>$rootScope</code> objects, which we use to set up our tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will be creating two functions that generate the mock objects
required for our tests. We&#8217;ll discuss these two functions in a bit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>scope is the AngularJS convention for the object into which all
functionality and state is stored. We create a new scope using the
AngularJS utility function <code>$rootScope.$new()</code> and store a
reference to this scope so we can test functionality we&#8217;ve implemented
in our actual code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We pass in the mocked objects (created by the mocked function
calls) as well as the scope object and instantiate a controller
object. This controller uses the scope to define functions and data,
and since we have a reference to it, we can call those functions and
inspect that data and assert our implementation is correct.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, let&#8217;s write an actual test:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">    describe( "#init", function() { <b class="conum">(1)</b>

            expect( repo.read ).toHaveBeenCalled();
            expect( scope.cities.length ).toEqual( 2 ); <b class="conum">(5)</b>
            expect( scope.city.name ).toEqual( "portland" );
            expect( scope.shops.length ).toEqual( 3 );
        });
    });
});</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Describe functions are used to group tests defined inside <code>it</code>
functions. Since we are testing the <code>init</code> function, it seems logical
to use an identifier called <code>#init</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>describe</code> blocks group tests while <code>it</code> blocks actually specify
code that is run as a test.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our controller code begins with an <code>init</code> call, so we mimic that
inside our test to set up the controller state.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We assert that our code uses the various interfaces we defined on
our injected objects: <code>getCurrentPosition</code> on the geo object, and <code>read</code>
on the repository object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then we assert that the data is properly loaded. Our test verifies that
there are two cities, that a default city has been loaded and the name
of the default city is equal to the string "portland". In addition,
the test verifies there are three shops loaded for the default
city. Behind the scenes in our implementation we will load these via
JSON, but all we care about is that the interface and data matches our
expectations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This syntax initially can look confusing if you have never written
Jasmine tests for JavaScript, but it actually solves a lot of problems
in an elegant way. Most importantly, Jasmine provides a <code>spyOn</code>
function that will intercept a call to it, and then allow you to
assert that it was called. Any place in our tests you see
<code>toHaveBeenCalled()</code> is an assertion that <code>spyOn</code> provides to us
proving that a call was made.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can implement the two mocking functions vital for the test. Put
them in between the <code>beforeEach( module( "coffeetech" ) )</code> line and
the <code><span class="keep-together">before</span>Each( inject( ... ) )</code> functions to provide proper
visibility to Karma:</p>

<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>We first implement the <code>generateMockLocation</code> function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mock location involves creating a geo object that has a single
function <code>get<span class="keep-together">Current</span>Position</code>, which is a function that calls back into
a success callback function provided. This exactly matches the native
browser support for Geolocation, which has the same function defined.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then <code>spyOn</code> the function so we can assert that it was called
in our actual tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we implement <code>generateMockRepositorySupport</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Again, we implement a mock object: this one to provide a method called
<code>read</code>. This function matches the function of the same name contained
in the API provided by the JavaScript GitHub.js library. Just like in
the previous mock, we <code>spyOn</code> the function so we can validate it was
called. However, this is not the "top-level" repository object&#x2014;this
is the object returned from the call to <code>getRepo</code>. We will take this
mock object and return it from the <code>getRepo</code> call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We spy on the <code>getRepo</code> call, and then return our next mock
object, the repository object. This object is used to retrieve the
actual information using the <code>read</code> call.</p>

<p>We extract the GitHub library into an AngularJS factory. This
allows us to inject our mocked GitHub object inside our tests; if we
had placed the GitHub instance-creation code inside our controller,
we would not have been able to easily mock it out in our tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We extract the geolocation support into an AngularJS factory. As
we did with the GitHub library mock, we can now inject a fake one into
our tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our new controller "injects" the various objects we need. We have
extracted the GitHub API object and a Geo object into dependencies,
and this syntax finds the proper objects and provides them to our
controller. You&#8217;ll also notice a slightly different syntax for
creating the controller: <code>controller( "CtrlName", [ 'dependency1',
'dependency2', function( dependency1, dependency2 ) {} ] );</code>. This
style works even if JavaScript minification were to occur; the
previous incarnation we saw would not have survived this process
because AngularJS would not have known the dependency name after
it had been mangled by a minimizer.</p>

<p>We extract the functionality into a function called <code>init</code>, which
we can explicitly call from within our tests.</p>

your own repository, modify this appropriately, but you can use these
arguments until you do post this into your own repository.</p>

<p>We use the <code>read</code> method to pull file contents from the
repository. Notice that we use the <code>gh-pages</code> branch since we are storing our
single-page app and all the data there.</p>

<li>
<p>Once our data is returned to us, it is simply a string. We need to
reconstitute this data to a JavaScript object using the <code>JSON.parse</code> method.</p>

<li>
<p>After we retrieve our data from the repository, we can use the
data inside the cities array to determine our current city.</p>

<p>We build a <code>getCurrentLocation</code> function we will call within

<p>We need to provide an error callback to the <code>getCurrentPosition</code>

<p>To build this test, I searched for "distance between Manila" and
Google autocompleted my search to "Cebu." It says they are 338 miles
apart. I then grabbed latitude and longitudes for those cities and
built the preceding test. I expected my test to fail as my coordinates
were going to be off by a few miles here or there. But the test
showed that our distance was 571. Hmm, perhaps we calculated in kilometers, not miles?
Indeed, I had forgotten this algorithm actually calculated the
distance in kilometers, not miles. So, we need to multiply the result
by 0.621371 to get the value in miles, which ends up being close
enough to what Google reports the distance to be.</p>

the keyboard shortcut "F12" or "Ctrl-Shift-I" on Windows or Linux or "Cmd-Opt-I" on Mac) will bring up
the developer console. Then select the

<p>You see at the point of error that we are calling <code>select</code> on the tree. select appears to be a method defined on an underscore character. If
you use JavaScript frequently, you&#8217;ll recognize that the underscore
variable comes from the Underscore library, and <code>select</code> is a method
that detects the first matching instance inside an array. Under the
hood, the GitHub.js library is pulling the entire tree from the
repository, then iterating over each item in the tree, then selecting
the item from the tree that matches the name of the file we have
requested. This is an important performance implication to consider;
the GitHub API does not provide a way to directly request content by
the path name. Instead, you pull a list of files and then request the
file by the SHA hash, a two-step process that makes two (potentially
lengthy) calls to the API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How do we fix the error telling us <code>select</code> is undefined? Did we forget
to include underscore.js? Reviewing the documentation on GitHub.js, we
see that it states underscore.js and base64.js are required. We forgot
to include them. Oops! To include these, run these commands from the
console:</p>

takes for GitHub to complete our fork request, which is

for the new repository. If we are using AngularJS, we can ask it for a
mocked and programmatic timeout interface, which we can control inside
our tests.</p>

<li>
<p>We start by creating our annotation function. As we specified in
our tests, this function takes a shop object, an object into which
annotations about the shop are added.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We prompt the user three times: username and password on GitHub,
and the text they want to annotate. If this seems like a really bad
way to do things, don&#8217;t worry, we&#8217;ll fix it in a moment.</p>

<li>
<p>We create a new GitHub object with the username and password
provided. We leave it as an exercise for the reader to contend with
mistyped or incorrect credentials.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The GitHub.js library allows you to create a repository object
(meaning create a local reference to an existing repository) using the
<code>getRepo</code> function. Once we have this, we can issue a <code>fork</code> to the
repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we did not get an error, we still need to contend with the fact
that forking takes a nondeterministic amount of time. So, we schedule
a timeout in 10 seconds, which will check to make sure our request
completed. As this operation is happening inside the browser, we have
no way of registering for a notification, and as such, must poll
GitHub to determine whether our fork has completed. In the real world,
we probably would need to redo this request if we see it fail as this
could just mean it was still pending on GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We register a message using a key called "forking" which we can
use inside our HTML template to display to the user that our fork has
completed. We&#8217;ll build this function out soon; it basically stores
the value and a string for display, and allows us to clear it when the
message is no longer valid.</p>

<li>
<p>Once we have verified the fork has completed, we need to get the
new forked repository. We use the username provided to our code when
the user logs in to build the repository object. We then read the
<em>cities.json</em> file from the repository; if we retrieve this file
successfully (we don&#8217;t see the <code>err</code> object evaluating to true) then
we know we are ready to start editing data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We notify the UI that we are annotating and tell the user they
will need to wait while the annotation request is in progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>JSON.stringify</code> converts our annotated shop object into a JSON
object. If you have used JSON.stringify before, you might not know
about the other two parameters (beyond just the object you want to
serialize) you can provide to this function. These
two extra parameters allow us to filter the object and specify certain
elements to ignore when serializing and how and if to indent the
resultant JSON. So, we provide the stripHashKey function to remove the
<code>$$hashKey</code> Angular tracking data, and an indentation count. The
indentation count makes it much easier to read a pull request, because
the diff&#8217;ing algorithm can diff line by line rather than as a long
JSON string, which is how <code>JSON.stringify</code> serializes by default.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then write data back to the forked repository using the <code>write</code>
function. If this succeeds, the error value will be undefined inside
the callback function as the last parameter.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If our error was undefined, we are in a position where we can make
a pull request back to the original repository. To make a pull
request, we create a pull request object we
need to provide to the pull request method inside of GitHub.js.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then get a reference to the target of the pull request, the
original repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then issue the pull request against the target. This takes the pull request
specification object we created earlier, and a callback function that
has an error code if the request failed, and otherwise, a pull request
object.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once the request has succeeded, we can notify the UI that the
annotation process has completed, and then issue a timeout to remove
that from the UI after 5000 milliseconds, or 5 seconds.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any time we are inside a callback in a third-party library (like
GitHub.js) we, as mentioned before, need to use <code>$apply()</code> to notify
Angular that our scope object has changed.</p>

<p>If I saw this app in the wild I would never use it to submit data. The
app asks for my GitHub username and password. Asking for my username
and password implicitly asks me to trust the authors of this
application. Trust in this case means that I trust them to not
maliciously use my credentials for nefarious purposes, and also asks
me to trust that they are not doing something stupid that would allow
an attacker to insert themselves into the middle of the
authentication process and steal my crendentials. GitHub is a large
part of my online identity and I would never provide these
crendentials to a web application.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, we have an alternative to asking for passwords: OAuth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we use OAuth, our users enter their credentials directly into
GitHub. If our users have turned on two-factor authentication, GitHub
can still authenticate them (while our naive implementation could not
be modified to accept this type of authentication process). Once we
have entered our credentials, GitHub decides whether we
are who we say we are, and then returns us to the application that
requested access.</p>

<td class="content">
There are many benefits to using OAuth. GitHub provides the
application with what is called an OAuth token that encapsulates
exactly what services on GitHub we have access to, and
whether that access is read-only or whether we can add data in a
read-write manner. This means our requesting service can ask to modify
only parts of our data within GitHub; this provides a much higher
level of trust to users as they know the application cannot touch the
more private parts within GitHub. Specifically, this means we could
ask for access only to gists and not request access to our
repositories. One important point about OAuth tokens is that they can
be revoked. So, once a specific action has been taken, we can destroy
the token and revoke access. With simple username and password access,
the only way to revoke access is to change the password, which means
any place you have saved that password (password managers or other
applications that log in via username and password) need to update
their settings as well. With OAuth we can revoke a single token at any
time (and GitHub makes it easy to do this) without affecting access to
other services.

<h4 id="_authentication_requires_a_server">Authentication Requires a Server</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Up until now we have been able to publish all our files into GitHub,
and they are hosted for us by GitHub. Sadly the authentication
component cannot be hosted on GitHub. Somehow we need to safely
authenticate our user into GitHub and retrieve an OAuth token. There
is currently no way to do this strictly
client side (using only static HTML and JavaScript running in the
browser). Other authentication providers like Facebook do provide pure
JavaScript login functionality in their SDKs, but GitHub, citing
security concerns, has not released anything that does authentication
purely on the client side as of yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Somehow we have to involve a server into our authentication process.
The most obvious choice we have is to run a small authentication
server, delegate authentication to it, and once authentication is
completed, jump back in our application hosted on GitHub. We provide
code (written in NodeJS, JavaScript for the server side) to do
this in the associated repository for this chapter. But creating even
a simple  authentication system has a baseline of complexity that
seems like overkill. If we could instead delegate this authentication
to a third party, we could reduce a massive amount of code and
complexity from our system.</p>

<h4 id="_fixing_authentication_with_firebase">Fixing Authentication with Firebase</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of writing our own server to manage authentication and talk to
the GitHub API, we will delegate that authentication to Firebase. Firebase is a
real-time communication toolset that integrates well with our choice
of AngularJS. By far the simplest and safest option,
Firebase offers AngularJS bindings (called "AngularFire") and an
integrated GitHub authentication component (called "Simple Login").
Together they resolve the authentication issue for us, and keep all
our code hosted on GitHub. Delegation of our authentication component is easy with
Firebase: we just modify our existing GitHub application, provide the credentials
and GitHub OAuth scope to Firebase, and then our application offloads
user management to Firebase.</p>

<h2 id="Jekyll">Ruby and Jekyll</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Jekyll project calls itself a "blog-aware, static site generator
in Ruby." At its core, Jekyll is a very simple set of
technologies for building websites. Simplicity is what gives Jekyll
its power: using Jekyll you will never have to learn about database
backends, complicated server installations, or any of the myriad
processes involved with most monolithic website technologies. Many
prominent technical bloggers use Jekyll as their blogging platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many of the open source technologies in heavy usage at GitHub,
Jekyll was originally developed by Tom Preson Warner, one of the
cofounders of GitHub, and Nick Quaranto, of 37 Signals, though there
are now thousands of contributors to the Jekyll codebase.
Unsurprisingly, the strength of the Jekyll tool comes not from the
brilliance of the original developers or the brilliance of the idea,
but the way those original developers cultivated community and
involvement among their users.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_learning_and_building_with_jekyll">Learning and Building with Jekyll</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we will investigate the structure of a Jekyll blog,
illustrating the few major technology pieces involved. Once we have
familiarized ourselves with Jekyll, we will then create a Jekyll blog
from scratch using the command-line tools. Then we will write a Ruby
program that scrapes a blog-like website and converts the scraped
information into a new Jekyll blog.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_jekyll">What Is Jekyll?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jekyll specifies a file structure format: conform to this format and
Jekyll will compile your files into HTML. Jekyll builds on top of two
proven tools: Markdown, a markup language that is surprisingly
readable and expressive, and Liquid Markup, a simple programming language that
gives you just enough components to build modern web
pages requiring conditionals and loops, but safe enough that you can
run untrusted pages on public servers. With these two technologies and
agreement on a layout structure, Jekyll can build very complicated websites paradoxically without requiring a complicated structure of files
and technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jekyll works natively with GitHub because a Jekyll blog is
stored as a Git repository. When you push files into GitHub from a
repository GitHub recognizes as a Jekyll site, GitHub
automatically rebuilds the site for you.
Jekyll is an open source generator and defines a format for your
source files, a format other tools can easily understand and
operate upon. This means you can build your own tools to interact with
a Jekyll blog. Combining an open source tool like Jekyll with a well-written API like the GitHub API makes for some powerful publishing
tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_operating_jekyll_locally">Operating Jekyll Locally</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To really use Jekyll, you&#8217;ll need the <code>jekyll</code> gem. As we explain in
<a href="#appendix">[appendix]</a>, we could install a ruby gem using this command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ gem install jekyll</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two issues with installing this way. The first is that any
commands we run inside the command line are lost to us and the world
(other than in our private shell history file). The second is that if
we are going to publish any of our sites to GitHub, we will want to
make sure we are matching the exact versions of Jekyll and its
dependencies so that a site that works on our local laptop also works
when published into GitHub. If you don&#8217;t take care of this, you&#8217;ll
occasionally get an email like this from GitHub:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"> The page build failed with the following error:

 page build failed

 For information on troubleshooting Jekyll see
 https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#troubleshooting
 If you have any questions please contact GitHub Support.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fix for these two issues is a simple one. You&#8217;ve probably seen other
chapters using a <code>Gemfile</code> to install Ruby libraries. Instead of
using a manual command like <code>bundle</code> to install from the command line,
let&#8217;s put this dependency into the Gemfile. Then, anyone else using
this repository can run the command <code>bundle install</code> and install the
correct dependencies. And instead of using the <code>jekyll</code> gem directly, use the
<code>github-pages</code> gem, which synchronizes your Jekyll gem versions with
those on GitHub. If you do get the preceding email, run the command <code>bundle update</code>
to make sure that everything is properly set up and synchronized and
generally this will reproduce the issues on your local setup, which is
a much faster place to fix them:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ printf "gem 'github-pages' &gt;&gt; Gemfile
$ bundle install</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating and managing your dependencies inside a Gemfile is the smart
way to get your Jekyll tool synced with the version running on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we are ready to create a Jekyll blog.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_jekyll_blog_quick_start">Jekyll Blog Quick Start</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have our required tools installed, so let&#8217;s create a simple blog. Run
these commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ jekyll new myblog
$ cd myblog</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>jekyll new</code> command creates the necessary structure for a
minimal Jekyll blog. Taking a look inside the directory, you&#8217;ll see a
few files that comprise the structure of a basic Jekyll blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>jekyll new</code> command installs two CSS files: one for
the blog (<em>main.css</em>) and one for syntax highlighting (<em>syntax.css</em>).
Remember, you are in full control of this site; the <em>main.css</em> file is
simply boilerplate, which you can completely throw away if it does not
suit your needs. The syntax file helps when including code snippets
and contains syntax highlighting CSS that prettifies many programming
languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Installation of a new blog comes with a <em>.gitignore</em> file as well that contains one entry: <em>_site</em>. When you use the Jekyll library to build your site locally, all files are by default built into the <em>_site</em> directory. This <em>.gitignore</em> file prevents those files from being included inside your repository as they are overwritten by the Jekyll command on GitHub when your files are pushed up to GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>jekyll new</code> command does not create or initialize a new Git
repository for you with your files. If you want to do this, you will need to
use the <code>git init</code> command. The Jekyll initialization command does create the
proper structure for you to easily add all files to a Git repository;
just use <code>git add .; git commit</code> and your <em>.gitignore</em> file will be added
and configure your repository to ignore unnecessary files like the
<em>_site</em> directory.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All your blog posts are stored in the <em>_posts</em> directory. Jekyll sites
are not required to have a <em>_posts</em> directory (you can use Jekyll with
any kind of static site) but if you do include files in this directory
Jekyll handles them in a special way. If you look in the <em>_posts</em>
directory now, you see that the Jekyll initialization command has
created <span class="keep-together">your first</span> post for you, something like
<em>_posts/2014-03-03-welcome-to-jekyll.Markdown</em>. These posts have a
special naming format: the title of the post (with any whitespace replaced with
hyphens) trailed by the date and then an extension (either <em>.Markdown</em>
or <em>.md</em> for Markdown files, or <em>.textile</em> for Textile).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your new Jekyll blog also comes with a few HTML files: an <em>index.html</em> file,
which is the starting point for your blog, and several layout files,
which are used as wrappers when generating your content. If you look
in the <em>_layouts</em> directory, notice there is a file named
<em>default.html</em> and another named <em>post.html</em>. These files are the
layout files, files that are wrapped around all generated content,
like those from your Markdown-formatted blog posts. For
example, the <em>post.html</em> file is wrapped around the generated content
of each file stored inside the <em>_posts</em> directory. First, the markup content is
turned into HTML and then the layout wrapper is applied. If you look
inside each of the files inside the <em>_layouts</em> directory, you will see
that each contains a placeholder with <code>{{ content }}</code>. This
placeholder is replaced with the generated content from other files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These placeholders are actually a markup language on their own:
<em>Liquid Markup</em>. Liquid Markup was developed and open sourced by
Shopify.com. Liquid Markup arose from a desire to have a safe way
to host programmatic constructs (like loops and variables) inside a
template, without exposing the rendering context
to a full-fledged programming environment. Shopify wanted to create a
way for untrusted users of its public-facing systems to upload
dynamic content but not worry that the markup language would permit
malicious activity; for example, given a full-fledged embedded
programming language, Shopify would open itself to attack if a user
wrote code to open network connections to sites on its internal
networks. Templating languages like PHP or ERB (embedded Ruby
templates, popular with the Ruby on Rails framework) allow fully
embedded code snippets, and while this is very powerful when you have full control
over your source documents, it can be dangerous to provide a mechanism
where that embedded code could look like <code>system("rm -rf /")</code>.
Liquid Markup provides many of the benefits of embedded programming templates,
without the dangers. We will show several examples of Liquid Markup
and how they work later in the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, your Jekyll directory has a special file called <em>_config.yml</em>.
This is the Jekyll configuration file. Peering into it, you&#8217;ll see it
is very basic:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">name: Your New Jekyll Site
markdown: redcarpet
highlighter: pygments</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We only have three lines to contend with and they are simple to
understand: the name of our site, the Markdown parser used by our
Jekyll command, and whether to use <code>pygments</code> to do syntax highlighting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To view this site locally run this command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ jekyll serve</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command builds the entirety of your Jekyll directory, and then
starts a mini web server to serve the files up to you. If you then
visit <em><a href="http://localhost:4000" class="bare">http://localhost:4000</a></em> in your web browser, you will see
something on the front page of your site and a single blog post listed in
the index, as shown in <a href="#bare-jekyll-site">A bare Jekyll site</a>.</p>

<p>Hopefully you agree that this is a fairly intuitive and readable
alternative to raw HTML. This simplicity and readability is one of the
major benefits of using Jekyll. Your source files maintain a
readability that allows you to focus on the content itself, not on the
technology that will eventually make them beautiful. Let&#8217;s go over
this file and investigate some of the important pieces.</p>

<div class="sect3">

<p>YFM is a snippet of YAML ("YAML Aint Markup Language")
delimited by three hyphens on both the top and bottom. YAML is a simple structured
data serialization language used by many open source projects instead
of XML. Many people find it more readable and editable by humans
than XML. The YFM in this file shows a few configuration options: a
layout, the title, the date, and a list of categories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The layout specified references one of the files in our <em>_layouts</em>
directory. If you don&#8217;t specify a layout file in the YFM, then Jekyll
assumes you want to use a file called <em>default.html</em> to wrap your
content. You can easily imagine adding your own custom layout files
to this directory and then overriding them in the YFM. If you look at
this file, you see that it manually specifies the <code>post</code> layout.</p>

<p>The title is used to generate the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag and can be used
anywhere else you need it inside your template using the double-braces syntax from Liquid Markup: <code>{{ page.title }}</code>. Notice that any
variable from the <em>_config.yml</em> file is prefixed with the <code>site.</code>
namespace, while variables from your YFM are prefixed with <code>page.</code>
Though the title matches the filename (after replacing
spaces with hyphens), changing the title in the YFM does not affect
the name of the URL generated by Jekyll. If you want to change the URL, you need to
rename the file itself. This is a nice benefit if you need to slightly modify the
title and don&#8217;t want to damage preexisting URLs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The date and categories are two other variables included in the YFM.
They are completely optional and strangely unused by the structure and
templates created by default using the Jekyll initializer. They do
provide additional context to the post, but are only stored in the
Markdown file and not included inside the generated content itself.
The categories list is often used to generate an index file of
categories with a list of each post included in a category. If you
come from a Wordpress background, you&#8217;ll likely have used categories.
These are generated dynamically from the MySQL database each time you
request a list of them, but in Jekyll this file is statically generated.
If you wanted something more dynamic, you could imagine generating a
JSON file with these categories and files, and then building a
JavaScript widget that requests this file and then does something
more interactive on the client side. Jekyll can take any template file
and convert it to JSON (or any other format)&#x2014;you are not limited to
just generating HTML files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>YFM is completely optional. A post or page can be rendered into your
Jekyll site without any YFM inside it. Without YFM, your page is
rendered using the defaults for those variables, so make sure the
default template, at the very least, is what you expect will wrap
around all pages left with unspecified layouts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important default variable for YFM is the published variable. This
variable is set to true by default. This means that if you create a
file in your Jekyll repository and do not manually specify the
published setting, it will be published automatically. If you set the
variable to false, the post will not be published. With
private repositories you can keep the contents of draft posts entirely
private until writing has completed by making sure published is set
to false. Unfortunately, not all tools that help you create Jekyll
Markdown files remember to set the published variable explicitly
inside of YFM, so make sure you check before committing the file to
your repository if there is something you don&#8217;t yet want published.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_jekyll_markup">Jekyll Markup</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Going past the YFM, we can start to see the structure of
Markdown files. Markdown files can be, at their simplest, just textual
information without any formatting characters. In fact, if your layout files are
well done, you can definitely create great blog posts without any
fancy formatting, just pure textual content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But with a few small Markdown additions, you can really make posts
shine. One of the first Markdown components we notice is the backtick
character, which is used to wrap small spans of code (or code-ish
information, like filenames in this case). As you use more and more
Markdown, you&#8217;ll find Markdown to be insidiously clever in the way it
provides formatting characters without the onerous weight that HTML
requires to offer the same explicit formatting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Links can be specified using <code>[format][link]</code>, where <code>link</code> is the
fully qualified URL (like "<em><a href="http://example.com" class="bare">http://example.com</a></em>"), or a reference to a
link at the bottom of the page. In our page we have two references,
keyed as <code>jekyll-gh</code> and <code>jekyll</code>; we can then use these inside our
page with syntax like <code>[Jekyll&#8217;s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]</code>. Using
references has an additional benefit in that you can use the link more
than once by its short name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though not offered in the sample, Markdown provides an easy way to
generate headers of varying degrees. To add a header, use the <code><mark></code>
character, and repeat the <code></mark></code> character to build smaller headers.
These delimiters simply map to the H tag; two hash characters (<code><mark></code>)
turns into an <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag. Building text enclosed by <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tags looks
like <code></mark># Some Text</code>. You can optionally match the same number of hash
symbols at the end of the line if you find it more expressive (<code><mark>#
Some Text </mark>#</code>), but you don&#8217;t have to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Markdown offers easy shortcuts for most HTML elements: numbered and
unordered lists, emphasis, and more. And, if you cannot find a
Markdown equivalent, you can embed normal HTML right next to
Markdown formatting characters. The best way to write Markdown is to
keep a
<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/Markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown
cheat sheet</a> near you when writing. <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber from Daring
Fireball</a> invented Markdown, and his site has a more in-depth

<p>Running <code>jekyll --help</code> will show you the options for running Jekyll.

there are a few other switches you&#8217;ll want to learn about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are authoring and adjusting a page often, and switching back
into your browser to see what it looks like, you&#8217;ll find utility in
the <code>-w</code> switch ("watch"). This can be used to automatically
regenerate the entire site if you make changes to any of the source
files. If you edit a post file and save it, that file will be
regenerated automatically. Without the <code>-w</code> switch you would need to
kill the Jekyll server, and then restart it.</p>

<p>To create a github.io personal blog site, your Jekyll blog should be
on the master branch of your Git repository. The repository should be
named <code>username.github.io</code> on GitHub. If everything is set up correctly
you can then publish your Jekyll blog by adding a remote for GitHub
and pushing your files up. If you use the <code>hub</code> tool (a command for
interacting with Git and GitHub), you can go from start to finish with
a few simple commands. Make sure to change the first line to reflect

<p>To host a blog on your own domain name, you need to use the <code>gh-pages</code>
branch inside your repository. You need to create a CNAME file in your
repository, and then finally establish DNS settings to point your domain to
the GitHub servers.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_gh_pages_branch">The gh-pages branch</h5>

<p>You will need to always remember to work on the gh-pages branch; if

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have pushed the CNAME file to your repository, you can verify
that GitHub thinks the blog is established correctly by visiting the
admin page of your repository. An easy way to get there is using the
<code>github</code> gem, which is no longer actively maintained but is still a useful command-line tool:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<p>Generally, establishing DNS settings for your site is straightforward.
It is easiest if you are setting up DNS with a <em>subdomain</em> as opposed

like <em>mypersonaldomain.com</em>, while a subdomain would be
<em>blog.mypersonaldomain.com</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting up a blog on a subdomain is simple: create a CNAME record in DNS that points
to <em>username.github.io</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For an apex domain, things are slightly more complicated. You must create DNS
A records to point to these IP addresses: <code>192.30.252.153</code> and
<code>192.30.252.154</code>.  These are the IP addresses right now; there is
always the possibility that GitHub could change these at some point in
the future. For this reason, hosting on apex domains is risky. If
GitHub needed to change its IP addresses (say during a denial-of-service attack), you would need to respond to this, and deal with the
DNS propagation issues. If you instead use a subdomain, the CNAME
record will automatically redirect to the correct IP even if it is
changed by GitHub.<span class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_3" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_3" title="View footnote.">3</a>]</span></p>

<h3 id="_importing_from_other_blogs">Importing from Other Blogs</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many tools that can be used to import an existing blog into
Jekyll. As Jekyll is really nothing more than a file-layout
convention, you just need to pull the relevant pieces (the post
itself, and associated metadata like the post title, publishing date,
etc.) and then write out a file with those contents. Jekyll blogs
prefer Markdown, but they work fine with HTML content, so you can
often convert a blog with minimal effort, and there are good tools
that automate things for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_from_wordpress">From Wordpress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most popular importer is the Wordpress importer. You will need the
'jekyll-import' gem. This gem is distributed separately from the core
Jekyll gem, but will be installed if you use the <code>github-pages</code> gem
inside your Gemfile and use the <code>bundle</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_importing_with_direct_database_access">Importing with direct database access</h5>

<p>Once you have the <code>jekyll-import</code> gem, you can convert a Wordpress

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";

      "user"     =&gt; "hastie",
      "password" =&gt; "lanyon",
      "host"     =&gt; "localhost",
      "status"         =&gt; ["publish"]
    })'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command will import from an existing Wordpress installation,
provided that your Ruby code can access your database. This will work if you can
log in to the server itself and run the command on the server, or if
the database is accessible across the network (which is generally bad
practice when hosting Wordpress!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the status option: this specifies that imported pages and posts
are published automatically. More specifically, the YAML for each file
will specify <code>published: true</code>, which will publish the page or post
into your blog. If you want to review each item individually, you can
specify a status of <code>private</code>, which will export the pages into Jekyll
but leave them unpublished. Remember that if your repository is
public, posts marked as unpublished will not be displayed in the blog but
can still be seen if someone visits your the repository for your blog
on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many more options than listed here. For example, by default,
the Wordpress-Jekyll importer imports categories from your Wordpress
database, but you can turn this off by specifying <code>"categories" &#8658;
false</code>.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_importing_from_the_wordpress_xml">Importing from the Wordpress XML</h5>

      "assets_folder" =&gt; "assets"
    })'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be used to export files from a server you don&#8217;t
maintain, but works with sites you do maintain and might be a more
plausible option than running against a database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To export the XML file, visit the export page on your Wordpress
site. This is usually mapped to <em>/wp-admin/export.php</em>, so it will be
something like <em><a href="https://blogname.com/wp-admin/export.php" class="bare">https://blogname.com/wp-admin/export.php</a></em> (replacing
&#x201c;blogname.com&#x201d; with your blog&#8217;s name).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many free tools, there are definitely limitations to using this
method of export. If your Wordpress site is anything beyond the
simplest of Wordpress sites, then using this tool to import from
Wordpress means you will lose much of the metadata stored inside your
blog. This metadata can include pages, tags, custom fields, and image
attachments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to keep this metadata, then you might
consider another import option like Exitwp. Exitwp is a Python tool
that provides a much higher level of fidelity between the original
Wordpress site and the final Jekyll site, but has a longer learning
curve and option set.</p>

<p>Jekyll provides various importers that make it easy to convert an
existing blog into a Jekyll blog. But if you have a nonstandard
blog, or a site that is not a blog, you still have options for
migrating it to Jekyll. The first option is to write your own importer
by perusing the <a href="http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import">source of the
Jekyll importers on GitHub</a>. This is probably the right way to
build an importer if you plan on letting others use it, as it will
extend several Jekyll importer classes already available to make
importing standard for other contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another option is to simply write out files in the simple format that
is a Jekyll blog. This is much lazier than reading through the Jekyll
tools and their libraries, of course. I started as a Perl programmer and
always loved this quote from Larry Wall, the creator of Perl: "We will
encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:
laziness, impatience, and hubris." Let&#8217;s accept our inherent laziness
and choose the second route. We&#8217;ll write some code to scrape a site
and make a new Jekyll site from scratch, learning about the structure
of a Jekyll blog through trial and error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While living in Brazil in 2000 I built a site called ByTravelers.com,
an early travel blog. At some point, I sadly lost the database and
thought the site contents were completely gone. Almost by accident, I
happened upon ByTravelers on Archive.org, the Internet Archive. I
found that almost all of the articles were listed there and
available. Though the actual database is long gone, could we recover
the data from the site using Archive.org?</p>

<p>We can start by looking at the structure of the archive presented on
Archive.org. Go to Archive.org, enter "bytravelers.com" into the
search box in the middle of the page, and then click "BROWSE HISTORY."
You will see a calendar view that shows all the pages
scraped by the Internet Archive for this site as shown in <a href="#calendar-view-archive">Calendar view of Archive.org</a>.</p>

was more or less complete at the height of the site&#8217;s functionality
and data. There are a few broken links to images, but otherwise the

<p>Taking the URL from our browser, we can use this as our starting point for

each URL to a journal entry uses a standard format; in other words,
<em><a href="http://www.bytravelers.com/journal/entry/56" class="bare">http://www.bytravelers.com/journal/entry/56</a></em> indicates the 56th
journal item stored on the site. With this knowledge in hand, we can

<p>A naive implementation of a scraper would be a single Ruby file in
which the execution and functionality were contained all in one.
However, if we expose the functionality as a class, and then
instantiate the class in a separate file, we can also write tests
that utilize and validate the same steps as the runner script. So,
let&#8217;s take this smarter approach and create three files: the scraper

<h4 id="_scraping_titles">Scraping Titles</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start with something simple: scraping the titles from the
site. We&#8217;ll use Ruby to scrape the site; Ruby has some intuitive gems like
mechanize that simplify building web clients. There is an API for
the Internet archive, but I found it flakey and unreliable, so we&#8217;ll
just scrape the site. Add these additional lines to the Gemfile using
this command and then install the libraries:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<p>We use a Ruby method called <code>attr_accessor</code>, which creates a public
instance variable. We can use variables created using <code>attr_accessor</code>
by prefixing the variable name with an <code>@</code> character. Instance
variables are accessible outside the class as well.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When a method named <code>initialize</code> is defined for a class, this
method is called right after object creation, so this is the appropriate
place for us to initialize the member variables.</p>

<p>You can see that some of the entries have a generic "Internet Archive
Wayback Machine" while some have "Read Journal Entries." Archive.org
will respond with a placeholder title when it does not have content
from the site (as is the case with item #58, for example). We should
ignore those pages that don&#8217;t have the string "Read Journal Entries"
as the title (which tells us Archive.org does have cached content from
our site).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two things that make Mechanize immensely powerful as the
foundation for a scraping tool: easy access to making HTTP calls, and
a powerful searching syntax once you have a remote document. You&#8217;ve
seen how Mechanize makes it simple to make a GET request. Let&#8217;s
explore sifting through a massive document to get the important pieces
of textual content. We can manually explore scraping using the Ruby
IRB (interactive Ruby shell):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">$ irb -r./scraper
2.0.0-p481 :001 &gt; scraper = Scraper.new
 =&gt; #&lt;Scraper:0x00000001e37ca8...&gt;
2.0.0-p481 :002 &gt; page = scraper.agent.get "#{scraper.root}#{56}"
 =&gt; #&lt;Mechanize::Page {url #&lt;URI::HTTP:0x00000001a85218...&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line invokes IRB and uses the <code>-r</code> switch to load the
scraper library in the current directory. If you have not used IRB
before, there are a few things to know that
will make life easier. The IRB has a prompt, which indicates the
version of Ruby you are using, and the index of the command you are
running. IRB has a lot of features beyond what we will discuss here,
but those indexes can be used to replay history and for job control,
like many other types of shells. At the IRB prompt you can enter Ruby
and IRB executes the command immediately. Once the command executes,
IRB prints the result; the characters <code>&#8658;</code> indicate the return
value. When you are playing with Ruby, return values will often be complex
objects: the return value when
you use <code>scraper.agent.get</code> is a Mechanize Ruby object. This is a very
large object, so printing it out takes a lot of real estate. We&#8217;ve
abbreviated the majority of it here, and will do that for many complex
objects to save space when discussing IRB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last command in IRB saves the HTTP GET request as a page object.
Once we have the page, how do we extract information from it?
Mechanize has a nice piece of syntactic sugar that makes it easy to
search the DOM structure: the "/" operator. Let&#8217;s try it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">2.0.0-p481 :003 &gt; page / "tr"
 =&gt; []</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If our query path had found anything, we would have seen a return
value with an array of Mechanize objects, but in this case we got back an
empty array (which indicates nothing was found). Unfortunately, the
paths vary when the document is loaded into a browser (the browser can
customize the DOM or the server can send slightly different data to
the client). But if we experiment with similar paths inside IRB, we
will find what we need. It helps to jump back and forth between Chrome
and IRB, examining the structure of the HTML inside Chrome and then
testing a search path using IRB. Eventually, we come across this search path:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">2.0.0-p481 :004 &gt; items = page /  "table[valign=top] tr"
 =&gt; [#&lt;Nokogiri::XML::Element:0xc05670 name="font"
      attributes=[#&lt;Nokogiri::XML::Attr:0xc05328 name="size"
      value="-2"&gt;]...
2.0.0-p481 :005 &gt; items.length
 =&gt; 5
2.0.0-p481 :006 &gt; items[0].text()
 =&gt; "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeautiful Belize\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"
2.0.0-p481 :005 &gt; items[0].text().strip
 =&gt; "Beautiful Belize"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eureka, we found the pattern that gives us our title. We had to jump
around inside the results from the query, but we can correlate the
text on the page inside the browser with different structures found
using the query inside IRB. It is important to note that we have to
strip whitespace from the title to make it presentable. We can
incorporate this into our scraper code, but this is a good moment to
think about how we can write tests to verify this works properly. And
when we start writing tests, we open the door for another opportunity:
caching to our HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Were we to run our <code>run.rb</code> script again, we would notice that it
prints the document title, then halts as it retrieves the content from
the server, and then prints again, stopping and starting until
complete. The content from Archive.org does not change at all since
the original site was
scraped years ago, so there is no reason we need to get the latest
content; content even several months stale will be the same as content
retrieved a few moments ago. It seems like a good opportunity to put a
caching layer between us and the code, reducing impact on Archive.org
and making our script run faster. In addition, if we structure our
code to make retrieval and processing happen independently, we can
write tests to verify the processing:</p>

<li>
<p>We require the VCR gem: this gem intercepts HTTP requests, sending
them out normally the first time, and caching all successive calls,
completely transparent to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VCR must be configured when you use it: in this case we specify a
directory where results will be cached, and tell it what mocking
library we should use to store the cached results.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We establish a new variable called pages. We will scrape all the
pages into this array (and get them for free once the information is
cached).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialize the pages array here.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To use the VCR recording feature, we wrap any code that makes
HTTP requests inside a VCR block with a name specifying the cassette
to save it under. In this case, we use a cassette named bt (for
ByTravelers) with the index of the page. The first time we use the
scraper to request the page, it is retrieved and stored inside the
cache. Successive calls to the scraper <code>get</code> method are retrieved from
the cached responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then look for any titles that look like pages archived into
Archive.org (using the title to differentiate) and if we find one,
store that page into our pages array for later processing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We move the title processing into its own method called
<code>process_title</code>. Here we use the information and remove any
whitespace.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside of <code>run</code> we now call <code>scrape</code> to load the pages, and then
iterate over each page, searching inside them and processing the titles.</p>

<p>We print out the errors (when Archive.org does not have a page for a

<li>
<p>We define a render method. This takes the processed information
(which arrives as a hash) and renders the information into the proper
format: the YAML Front Matter (YFM) and then the body (which we don&#8217;t
have yet). We then return the rendered string.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We use the <code>to_yaml</code> method on our hash. This method appears when
we include the yaml library using <code>require 'yaml'</code> (not displayed
here, but easy to add to the <em>scraper.rb</em> file and present in the
samples on GitHub).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The write method writes the rendered content to disk. It makes
sure the <em>_posts</em> directory is available, and if not, creates it. It
then writes out the file using our <code>get_filename</code> method to get the
path, prefixed with the <em>_posts</em> directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>process_creation_date</code> takes a piece from the scraped page and
breaks it apart by the string &#x201c;<code>last updated</code> on:&#x201d; and uses the second
item in the resultant array.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Inside our run method we now build out the processed hash, finding
the date and title using rows from the query path we used before.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we have our processed array, we can "render" it and then
write out the rendered string to our filesystem.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we generate the posts by calling <code>bundle exec ruby ./run.rb</code> we

<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, for now, posts are nothing more than the YFM, but this
is still a perfectly valid Jekyll post.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s use the jekyll command-line tool to start looking at our
posts and to troubleshoot any issues with our Jekyll repository.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_using_the_jekyll_command_line_tool">Using the Jekyll Command-Line Tool</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Taking a moment to add our files to the Git repository, we can then
take a look at our site using the <code>jekyll</code> command-line tool. Using
the command-line tool locally will spot check our new content as we
will see errors immediately (rather than getting notification emails
from GitHub after publishing there). Errors can occur if our scraper
does not correctly process the HTML retrieved from Archive.org and
subsequently generates incorrect Markdown content, for example.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, we see a few problems already. First, we don&#8217;t have a layout for
"post." And, there is no configuration file. Let&#8217;s fix these problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Add a file called <em>_config.yml</em> to the root directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">name: ByTravelers.com: Online travel information
markdown: redcarpet
highlighter: pygments</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember, the jekyll tool does not reload the configuration file
automatically, so we should restart the tool by hitting Ctrl-C and
restarting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, create a directory called <em>_layouts</em>, and place a file called
<em>post.html</em> inside it with these contents:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">---
layout: default
---

&lt;h1&gt;{{ page.title }}&lt;/h1&gt;

{{ content }}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <em>post.html</em> layout file is very simple: we use Liquid Markup tags
to write out the title of the site (contained in an object called
<code>page</code>, which our template has access to) and then the content itself,
which is the rendered output from the post page.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also need to create a "default" layout, so create this inside the
<em>_layouts</em> directory with the filename <em>default.html</em>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;ByTravelers.com&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;

&lt;body&gt;

{{ content }}

&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This file is almost pure HTML, with only the <code>{{ content }}</code> tag. When
we specify <code>default</code> as the layout inside YAML for a Markdown file,
the Markdown text is converted to HTML, and then this layout file is
wrapped around it. You can see that the initial post files specify the
<code>post</code> layout, which is wrapped around the content, then the
<em>post.html</em> layout file specifies the <em>default.html</em> layout, which is
wrapped around the entire contents.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we add these files, the Jekyll tool will notice the filesystem has changed and regenerate files. We now have generated posts, but
we don&#8217;t have a master index file, so let&#8217;s add this now.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_master_index_file_with_liquid_markup">Master Index File with Liquid Markup</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now have the posts generated properly, but we don&#8217;t have an entry page into the blog. We can create an <em>index.md</em> file, which just displays an index of all the blog posts:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">---

Crowd sourced travel information.

&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
{% for post in site.posts %}
&lt;a href="{{ post.url }}"&gt;&lt;h2&gt; {{ post.title }} &lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
{{ post.content | strip_html | truncatewords: 40 }}
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;em&gt;Posted on {{ post.date | date_to_string }}&lt;/em&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
{% endfor %}
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the file combines Markdown (the single <code>#</code> character
converts into an H1 tag) with regular HTML. You are free to mix
regular HTML inside of Markdown files when there is not a Markdown
equivalent.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Output tags use double braces surrounding the
content (<code>{{ site.title }}</code>) while logic tags use a brace and percent
symbol (<code>{% if site.title %}</code>). As you might expect, output tags place
some type of visible output into the page, and logic tags perform some
logic operation, like conditionals or loops.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The preceding template has both output and logic tags. We see a logic tag
in the form of <code>{% for &#8230;&#8203; %}</code>, which loops over each post. Jekyll will
process the entire posts directory and provide it to pages inside the
<code>site.posts</code> variable, and the <code>for</code> logic tag allows us to iterate
over them. If we use a <code>{% for &#8230;&#8203; %}</code> tag we need to "close" the tag
with a matching <code>{% endfor %}</code> tag. Inside of our for
loop we have several output tags: <code>{{ post.url }}</code> outputs the post
URL associated with a post, for example. We also have <em>filters</em>, which
are methods defined to process data. One such filter is the
<code>strip_html</code> filter, which you might guess strips out HTML text,
converting it to escaped text. This is necessary when your text could
include HTML tags. You&#8217;ll also notice that filters can be "chained";
we process the body with the <code>strip_html</code> filter and then truncate the
text by 40 characters using the <code>truncatewords:40</code> filter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we open <em><a href="http://localhost:4000" class="bare">http://localhost:4000</a></em> in our browser, we will see a
simple index page with the titles of our posts, like <a href="#austere_but_a_step_in_the_right_direction">The Index Page, for a naked Jekyll blog</a>.</p>

<p>This index page lists every post: let&#8217;s make it display only the last

site.posts | limit:10 %}</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each post has an associated page that is generated by Jekyll.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We start by looking at the second row and converting it to raw HTML.
We see there is a string author:, which is a likely place to
reference the author. This string is wrapped by a font tag and a
td tag, so we can use these search queries to eliminate extra
information. Then, we convert the HTML to text using the <code>text()</code> method
and use a regular expression to pull out the text after the author:
string. If a regular expression matches and has a captured expression,
it will be held in the global variable <code>$1</code>. There is more than one
way to get this information, of course.</p>

constructs inside a Markdown file, and we documented the most
important concepts around using this templating language. By
investigating the internals of a Jekyll post, we explained the
intricacies of YAML Front Matter (YFM) and how seamlessly you can mix
and match HTML with Markdown syntax. Jekyll blogs can utilize their
own custom CSS, and we&#8217;ve shown how easy it is
to use a powerful complete library like Bootstrap layered underneath a
site-specific small CSS file. And, we built a scraper application
that retrieves a remote site in its entirety and converts it into the
correct structure of a Jekyll blog. Even though this scraper application was
built specifically for a particular site, by adding testing and
properly structuring the components it should be evident how to reuse
much of the scraper for anything else you want to quickly convert into
a Jekyll blog.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though the phrase has now been removed from its marketing materials,
GitHub used to call itself a tool for "social coding." This idea is
still central to the services GitHub provides&#x2014;intimate access to the
social layer inside of GitHub through the Activity API.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we&#8217;ll investigate the Activity API by extending a chat
robot. You might find it odd that a robot, generally considered an antisocial
invention despite all best attempts, would play nicely with a social
API, but this is a social robot. GitHubbers use an
extensible chat robot called Hubot to record and automate their tasks,
and to have fun on the Internet. If there were any robot suited for
interacting with the GitHub Activity API, it&#8217;s Hubot, described on the
site <a href="https://hubot.github.com/" class="bare">https://hubot.github.com/</a> as "a customizable, kegerator-powered life
embetterment robot."</p>

<p>Hubot provides the skeleton for our chat robot. We&#8217;ll add the preceding

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_considerations_and_limitations">Considerations and Limitations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want stability with your Hubot, you need to host it on a
server. Hubot is written in NodeJS and requires a hosting service that
supports NodeJS. Our Hubot needs to sit on a public IP address (not
inside the firewall) because we receive notifications from GitHub. It
is not strictly required that you host Hubot on a public server; if
your Hubot does not need to receive requests from the outside world,
you can host on a private internal server as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest and cheapest hosting service for Hubot is Heroku. Once we
generate our Hubot, we can simply do a git-push into Heroku to publish
our chat robot for free. We&#8217;ll show these steps later in the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hubot works with many chat endpoints. Your Hubot can connect to almost
any popular chat service or protocol: IRC, XMPP, and many commercial
services like Gchat, Basecamp, and even Twitter. Slack is a relatively new
entrant into the world of chat services, but despite its youth, the
Slack API is solid and connecting third-party clients to the Slack
service is simple and straightforward. We&#8217;ll use Slack as our chat endpoint.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s create our Hubot and configure it to use Slack.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_creating_a_vanilla_hubot">Creating a Vanilla Hubot</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To build a Hubot you will need a working NodeJS installation, as
specified in <a href="#appendix">[appendix]</a>. The following commands create a
directory with a barebones Hubot:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>$ npm install -g generator-hubot <b class="conum">(1)</b>

<p>You may not be familiar with these commands, so let&#8217;s go over the
important ones.</p>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>npm is the tool that installs packages for NodeJS (documented in
<a href="#appendix">[appendix]</a>). The <code>npm install -g
generator-hubot</code> command installs a command-line tool called yeoman
and a plug-in for yeoman that scaffolds Hubot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should create a new directory and enter it so that when you
create your Hubot you can store it entirely in its own space.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You run the generator using the <code>yo hubot</code> command. This builds
out the set of files for a minimal Hubot.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then install the slack adapter and save the package to the
<em>package.json</em> file.</p>

simple, we will use the name "#general." Once you click

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Eventually you will want to run your Hubot on a server, but Hubot can
run from a laptop behind a firewall as well. At the beginning of
development, while testing and developing your bot and the changes are
fast and furious, you probably want to run Hubot
locally. In fact, Hubot behind a firewall is almost identical in its
feature set with one major exception: anything behind the firewall is
inaccessible, obviously, to external services. We are eventually going
to be configuring GitHub to send events to us when a pull request is
created, and Hubot behind the firewall cannot receive those
events. But, for almost all other functionality, running Hubot locally
speeds up development cadence.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You might also want to publish this repository into GitHub. Heroku,
as a part of hosting your live application, also hosts the full Git
repository of your Hubot (Hubot, as friendly as it tries to be, is
just another NodeJS application in the end). Heroku can host the
entirety of the source code for your Hubot for you, but does not have
the additional tools, like user management, that GitHub does. For this
reason, use your GitHub account as your code repository, the place where
team members develop new features of your chatbot. Build and test
locally, and then push into Heroku using the ease of the Git workflow
as a deployment layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have created and installed Hubot, let&#8217;s look at the
Activity API and determine how we want to code our extension.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_activity_api_overview">Activity API Overview</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Activity API centers around notifications: notifications are similar
to the notifications you see on social networking sites, events that
occur that document important points of interest inside a timeline of
activity. GitHub activity events are often tied to important
milestones inside of a developer&#8217;s day, activities like pushing
commits into the main remote repository, asking questions on
discussion threads associated with a repository, or assigning issues
to a developer for review.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These notifications are accessible to team members without
programmatically accessing the GitHub API. Team members are notified
of events inside of their workflow using email based on several
rules. GitHub will automatically send out notification emails when a
user has watched a repository and issues or comments are added, a pull
request is made, or there are comments made on a commit. In addition,
even if a user has not watched a repository, they will be notified if
that user is <em>@mentioned</em> (prefixing the @ character to a team
member&#8217;s name inside a comment), when an issue is assigned to them, or
when that user participates in a discussion associated with any
repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub policy for notification is definitely to err on the side of
being overly verbose. Many people live in their email, and making sure
that all important activities are distributed to the right people
involved makes sense. GitHub has a good set of rules for making
sure the correct notifications get to the right parties.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Email does falter as a to-do list, however, and at times the ease in
which email can be delivered breeds a secondary problem: overwhelm. It
can be very easy to lose focus (vital to building software) when you
are constantly context switching by checking email, and notifications
can often fly by. In addition, email is privately directed and
prevents easy collaboration; generally people don&#8217;t share email
inboxes. Let&#8217;s extend our Hubot to help us resolve these problems by taking
our GitHub notifications into a shared and "opt-in when you are logged-in"
communication channel.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_writing_a_hubot_extension">Writing a Hubot Extension</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hubot extensions are written in either JavaScript or
CoffeeScript. CoffeeScript is a intermediate language that compiles
directly to JavaScript. Many people prefer writing in CoffeeScript
because it has a cleaner syntax and writes "safer"
JavaScript (the syntax helps you avoid common tricky pitfalls in the
JavaScript language, like what "this" refers to).
CoffeeScript is an indentation-based language (much like
Python), and after the initial learning curve, can feel easier to read
than JavaScript, especially when you have many nested function
callbacks (common in JavaScript programming); it is easier to see
where a function begins and ends given the indentation levels. Hubot
is itself written in CoffeeScript, and we&#8217;ll write our extension in
CoffeeScript as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
CoffeeScript is a language where indentation is important. For
readability purposes, when we display a snippet of code from a longer
file, there are times where we have changed the indentation of that
snippet and removed the initial indentation. If you were to copy the
code without realignment, the snippet would not work until you
reindented it to fit the context into which it sits.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Hubot extension module format is exceedingly simple. You write
JavaScript modules (using the <code>export</code> syntax) and Hubot passes you in
a robot object you program using several API methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few concepts useful to programming Hubot. You can find
an example of each of these methods inside the <em>example.coffee</em> file
inside the <em>scripts</em> directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Hubot has a "brain." This is an internal state object, which means
these values persist across chat messages. This state is not
persisted into a database by default, so this state is not restored
if you restart Hubot. However, a persistence mechanism is exposed
via Redis, though this is optional and requires configuration. The
brain is the way you set and get values that are saved across
discrete messages.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubot has different response mechanisms. They can choose to respond
only when they hear exact phrases or when keywords are found in any
message, and you don&#8217;t need to do the grunt work inside your code to
determine the differences between these communication types.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubot includes an HTTP server. You might need your Hubot to accept
requests from additional services beyond the chat service, and Hubot
makes it easy to accept these kinds of requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubot has a built-in HTTP client. You can easily access HTTP
resources within Hubot; many popular extensions to Hubot access a
web service when Hubot receives a request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubot commands can include parameters. You can tell a Hubot to
do something multiple times and write a generic function that
accepts options.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubot can handle events. Each chat service has a generalized set of
events that are normalized to a common API. Hubot can be programmed
to interact with these events. For example, Hubot can perform
actions when a room topic changes or when users leave rooms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hubot can handle generic errors at the top level. Hubot can be
programmed with a catch-all error handler so that no matter where
your code failed, you can catch it without crashing your bot.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hubot will use the first five of these features:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>We will use the Hubot brain to store a PR review request. If Hubot
asks a user to review a PR, it needs to keep track of this so that
when the user responds it has some context of the request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will use the respond method to program our Hubot to handle a
request when a user accepts or declines the review request.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will use the HTTP server to accept PR notifications from GitHub
webhooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will use the HTTP client to get a list of users from Slack.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We will use the parameterization of requests to Hubot to retrieve
the specific pull request ID from a chat user message.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are examples of the other two features (events and generic
errors) inside the examples script that ship with the Hubot source
code but we won&#8217;t use those APIs in our Hubot.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_reviews_via_pull_requests">Code Reviews via Pull Requests</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we&#8217;ve seen in other chapters, pull requests are the mechanism used
on GitHub to easily integrate code changes into a project. Contributors
either fork the master repository and then issue a pull request against that
repository, or, if they have write permission to the main
repository, make a "feature" branch and then issue a pull request
against the "master" branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pull requests often come with a chat message indicating several people
who should review the request. This tribal knowledge about who should
be involved is only in the head of the developer who created the
code. It could be that they invited the correct people. Or, it could
be that they invited the people they prefer to review their code
for various (and completely rational reasons). This can be an
effective way to engage the right people around a new piece of
code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And inviting reviewers this way can have downsides as well: if the
person is otherwise engaged, pull requests can linger when a
notification email goes unread. And, there is good research to
indicate that the best performing teams are those who share all tasks
and responsibilities equally. It often does not scale to ask everyone
to participate in all code reviews associated with a pull
request. But it might be the case that randomly selecting developers
involved in a project is a better (and more efficient) way to review
code than asking the developer who created the code to determine these people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hubot will assign active chat room users to do code
reviews when a new pull request is created. We will use the GitHub
Activity API to subscribe to pull request events. When Hubot
becomes aware that a pull request needs review, it will randomly
assign a user in the chat room to do the review and then ask that user
if they want to accept the challenge. If they accept, we will note
that in the pull request comments.</p>

<p>We will start writing our extension by defining the high-level
communication format we expect from our users. Our script has a simple
vocabulary: look for responses indicating acceptance or refusal of our
review requests. Our extension script should be in the
<em>scripts</em> directory and named <em>pr-delegator.coffee</em>. This is just the
back and forth we will be having with users; we are not yet writing
any code to handle the pull request notifications:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a dense piece of code and can be confusing if you are new to
CoffeeScript. At the same time, hopefully you will agree that this is
amazingly powerful code for such a small snippet after reading these notes.</p>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>All NodeJS modules start by defining entrypoints using the
<code>exports</code> syntax. This code defines a function that expects a single
parameter; when the function is executed, the parameter will be called a
robot. The Hubot framework will pass in a robot object for us that we
will program further down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Hubot API defines a method on the robot object called
<code>respond</code>, which we use here. It takes two parameters: a regular
expression to match against and a function that receives an instance of
the chat response object (called <code>res</code> here). The second line uses
the API for this response object to call a method <code>accept</code> with the
response object. We define accept in a moment.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We setup a response matcher for a decline response.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we define the <code>accept</code> method. The accept method receives the
response object generated by the Hubot framework and calls the <code>reply</code>
method, which, you guessed it, sends a message back into the chat
channel with the text "Thanks, you got it!"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The accept method then also calls <code>console.log</code> with information
that is displayed on the console from which we started Hubot. This is
a simple way for us to assure everything worked correctly; if we don&#8217;t
see this message, our code before this was broken. The <code>console.log</code>
is not visible to any users in the channel. It is good practice to
remove this code when you finalize your production code, but if you
forget, it won&#8217;t affect anything happening in the channel.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then define the <code>decline</code> method using the same APIs as for the
<code>accept</code> method.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Hubot is running, you will need to restart it to reload any
scripts. Kill Hubot (using Ctrl-C), and then restart it, and then
play with commands inside your Slack site. Enter the commands
<code>probot accept</code> and <code>probot decline</code> and you&#8217;ll see Hubot
responding inside the channel. You&#8217;ll also see the message <code>Accepted!</code> or
<code>Declined!</code> printed to the console on which Hubot is
running.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_writing_tests_for_hubot_extensions">Writing tests for Hubot extensions</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have the basics of our Hubot working, let&#8217;s make sure we
certify our code with some tests. We&#8217;ll use the Jasmine testing
framework for NodeJS. It offers an elegant behavior-driven testing
syntax where you specify a behavior as the first parameter to an <code>it</code>
function, and as a second parameter, a function that is run as the
test itself. Jasmine manages running each <code>it</code> call and displays a
nice output of passing and failed tests at the end of your
run. Jasmine tests are typically written in JavaScript, but the latest versions of
Jasmine support tests are also written in CoffeeScript. Hubot is written
in CoffeeScript, so let&#8217;s write our tests in CoffeeScript as
well. We need to put our tests inside a
directory called <em>spec</em> and make sure our filename ends with
<em>.spec.coffee</em>. Let&#8217;s use <em>spec/pr-delegator.spec.coffee</em> as the
complete filename. Jasmine expects spec files to have <em>.spec.</em> at the
end of their filename (before the extension, either <em>.js</em> or
<em>.coffee</em>); if your filename does not match this pattern Jasmine won&#8217;t
recognize it as a test.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line in our test requires, or loads, the Hubot extension
module into our test script, giving us a function we save as a Probot
variable. We then create a <code>describe</code>
function, which is an organizing function to group tests. <code>describe</code>
functions take an indentifier (in this case <code>#probot</code>) and a function
that contains multiple <code>it</code> calls. In addition, a <code>describe</code> function
can also contain a <code>beforeEach</code> function that configures common
elements inside our <code>it</code> calls; in this case we create a faked robot
object we will pass into our <code>Probot</code> function call. When we are
running Hubot itself, Hubot creates the robot and passes it into the
<code>Probot</code> function, but when we run our tests, we generate a fake one
and query it to make sure it is receiving the proper
configuration. If we make a change inside our actual Hubot code and
forget to update our tests to verify those changes, our tests will
fail and we&#8217;ll know we need to either augment our tests, or something
broke inside our robot, a good automated sanity check for us when we
are feverishly coding away, animating our helpful Hubot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should see some similarities between the calls made to our robot
(<code>robot.respond</code> and <code>robot.router.post</code>) and the tests. We set up
"spies" using Jasmine that generate fake function calls capable of
recording any interaction from outside sources (either our production
code or the test code harness). Inside our <code>it</code> call, we
then verify that those calls were made. We use the <code>expect</code> function
to verify that we made two calls to the <code>respond</code> function
defined on the robot, and that <code>robot.router.post</code> has been called as
well.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need to install Jasmine, and we do this by adding to our
<em>package.json</em> file. Append <code>"jasmine-node": "^1.14.5"</code> to the file,

<p>There is a bit of bash cleverness here, but nothing to be overly
disturbed by. We create a few variables we use in the final
command. Since the $CONFIG variable is particularly long, we use <code>echo</code>
to print out a bunch of information with the webhook URL in the
middle. If you want to see the result of that variable, type <code>echo
$CONFIG</code> and you&#8217;ll notice the snippet <code>&#8230;&#8203; "url":
"https://inqry-chatbot.herokuapp.com/pr" &#8230;&#8203;</code> properly interpolated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we use the Heroku API URL as our webhook endpoint. This means we
need to have things hosted on Heroku for the webhook to talk to our
HTTP server properly. We can do some things (like connecting the Hubot to
the Slack service) from behind a firewall and have it talk with other
chat room participants, but any webhook request will fail unless the
chat client is running on a publicly available server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Be careful to make sure you use the <code>content_type</code> set to "form" (which
is the default, so you could leave it blank). Setting this to <code>json</code> will
make it difficult to retrieve the raw body inside your Hubot when the
post request is received and validate the request using a secure
digest. We want to make sure all requests are real requests from GitHub
and not a cracker attempting to maliciously inject themselves into our
conversations. To protect from this possible situation, we verify each
request back into GitHub by using the secret generated
when we created the webhook. We&#8217;ll discuss this in detail later in this
chapter, but for now, establish a secret when you create the hook. A
cracker might be able to guess about where our endpoint exists, but
unless Heroku or GitHub is compromised, they won&#8217;t know our webhook secret.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We should update our tests to make sure we anticipate this new
functionality. We will be using the Hubot HTTP server, which
piggybacks on the built-in express server running inside of Hubot. Our
new test should reflect that we use the <code>router.post</code> method exposed
to our Hubot, and that it is called once. We add this next test to the
end of our spec file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript">it "should verify our calls to router.post", (done) -&gt;

        done()</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This additional test will fail should we run it. Now we can add to our
Hubot and have it handle webhook callbacks from GitHub. Add this to
the end of the file:</p>

<p>Now if we run our tests, they all pass. If they do, publish our new
version of the app into Heroku. We&#8217;ll omit this step in the future,

<p>We can now start testing our Hubot with real GitHub

<li>
<p>Issue a pull request</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of this can be automated using a combination of Git commands and cURL.
We&#8217;ve seen some of these commands before and can reuse the previous
command-line invocations and variables we used when generating
our webhook using the API via cURL. Our config variable is similar,
but the required fields in this case are: the title and body for the
pull request, the "head" key that matches the name of the branch, and
where to merge it to using the "base" key.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating a new branch, adding some content, and then issuing a pull
request against the branch might be something we need to do several
(or more) times as we experiment and learn about the Hubot extension
API. The examples here work right out of the box, but don&#8217;t be fooled
into thinking that it all went exactly as we expected the first time.
Given that, these are commands you might want to perform multiple times as you are
experimenting, so let&#8217;s put the commands described in the previous paragraph
into a bash script that is generic and can be run multiple times. We
can call it issue-pull-request.sh and place the script inside the

update to the three variables at the top of the script to match your

had expired) this command would do nothing other than add testing data
to your test repository, so you can experiment safely. Just be sure

<p>These requests all failed; our Hubot is not correctly configured
to handle real HTTP requests from GitHub. This does show that GitHub is
trying to do something when a pull request is received. We&#8217;ll work on
getting our handler code written and pushed into Heroku, and then
issue another PR.</p>

<h4 id="_handling_pr_notifications_as_post_requests_over_http">Handling PR Notifications as Post Requests over HTTP</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s build our HTTP handler when PR notifications arrive from
GitHub. At first glance, we might take the easy route, adding it
directly into the top-level script. But given the fact that
JavaScript handles events inside of callbacks and the fact that Hubot
extensions only export a single constructor (using the
<code>module.exports</code> syntax), it is easier to create, and more importantly
test, a separate module, which we require in our main extension script.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We start by writing our tests. We&#8217;ve already created a test that
verifies the call to <code>robot.router.post</code>. Our new functionality will
actually handle the PR notification, so let&#8217;s add a new grouping using
the describe syntax and call it "#pr". The new functionality is
simple: if the Hubot receives the proper parameters (most importantly
that the internal secret matches the secret sent on the request) then
we accept the PR as valid and message our room with further
instructions, namely inviting some user to review this pull
request. Our handler then needs to expose two methods:
<code><span class="keep-together">prHandler</span></code>, which is where we delegate any information coming from an
HTTP request to the <code>/pr</code> route, and a method where we can configure
the secret, which we call <code>set<span class="keep-together">Secret</span></code>. Once we have established this
internal signature for our handler library, we can add two simple
tests and then our library.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have two tests: one that handles the correct flow and one that
handles the incorrect flow. In a before block (this happens before
each test) we set up a fake robot, and set the secret on our handler
module. Our faked robot implements the same methods a real Hubot
robot does (the messageRoom and send methods), but we create
Jasmine spies to verify these functions are called inside our
implementation code:</p>

<p>As you can see, the Hubot API does a lot of work for us: it processes
the JSON POST request to the <code>/pr</code> endpoint and provides us with the
parsed parameters inside the body object. We use that to retrieve the
secret from the request. Even if you have used CoffeeScript before,
you may not be familiar with the <code>?.</code> syntax: this just tests to see
if <code>body</code> is defined and if so, has a key named <code>secret</code>. This prevents
us from crashing if the secret is not sent in with the request. If the
secret from the request matches the configured secret, then we message
the room; otherwise we ignore the request. In either case, we need to
respond to the calling server by using the <code>send</code> method (<code>send</code> is
provided by the built-in <em>express</em> server Hubot uses to provide
an HTTP server). For debugging purposes we output that the secret
was validated, if it was in fact validated, but otherwise the behavior
of our response to the calling client is the same regardless of
whether they provided a correct secret or not. We don&#8217;t want to
provide an attacker with anything extra if they pass in an incorrect secret.</p>

<p>Hubot will spawn the HTTP server wherever it runs so we can talk to it
on our local machine (though this will likely be inside a firewall and
inaccessible to GitHub), so we can test it using cURL

<p>These commands verify that things are working properly. First, we
start the server, piping the output to <code>grep</code> to constrain output
related to our secret processing (we also background the
entire chain using an ampersand and parentheses, a bash trick). Then,
we hit the server running locally without the secret: the server (as
it is running in the same shell) prints out the
message "Invalid secret" using <code>console.log</code>, and then cURL prints out
"OK," which is what was returned from our server. If we run the command
again, this time including the secret as post parameters, we see that
Hubot verified the secret internally against its own secret, and then
cURL again prints "OK," which was what the express server inside of
Hubot returned to the calling client. The final line quits Hubot:
this command finds the PID for the Hubot client (which runs as a node
process) and then sends it a SIGHUP signal, signaling to Hubot that it
should quit.</p>

without going through the formality of actually generating a pull
request. Between our script, which issues real pull requests through the
GitHub API, and this one that fakes a webhook notification, we have the
ability to test our code externally as we develop it. Of course, our
tests are valuable, but sometimes it is impossible to understand
what is happening inside of our Hubot without running against the
real Hubot and not a test harness.</p>

exactly as we need it to if you were to disregard any code from this

get that data, the Slack API. I wrote the chapter using the Slack

<p>Initially I planned to remove
this entire section. However, it does demonstrate the ease of using an
external service through the built-in HTTP client, which is a powerful
feature of Hubot. And it also demonstrates how powerful tests aid you
when developing a Hubot extension; I was able to refactor to use a
radically different internal code path for getting the list of users
and maintain faith that the end-to-end process of my code works by
refactoring and then fixing broken tests. And, though not important
for this section per se, the Slack API provides much richer data on
the users logged in to a room, which could be valuable in other
situations. If you want to skip to the next section, you will have all
the code to build our Hubot as we described earlier. But I think it
is a worthwhile read for general Hubot understanding.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our tests are now broken: we now have the failure <code>TypeError:
Object #&lt;Object&gt; has no method 'http'</code>. Our mocked robot object that
we pass into our tests does not have the HTTP interface that comes
with Hubot, so we should add it to our custom Robot. The method
signature for the HTTP client (which comes from the
<code>node-scoped-http-client</code> NodeJS package) is hairy: you chain calls
together to build up an HTTP client request and end up with a function
returned into which you pass a callback where you handle the response
body. This module makes you write code that is not particularly
testable (said another way, it was challenging for me to understand
what the faked test implementation should look like), but the setup
code does work and the test itself documents an interface to our robot,
which is easily understandable. We simulate the
same chain, defining an <code>http</code> attribute on the mocked robot object, an
attribute that resolves to a function call itself. Calling that function
returns an object that has a <code>get</code> method, and calling that function
returns a function callback that when called executes that function
with three parameters. In real life that function callback would
contain the error code, the response object, and the JSON. In our
case, as long as the error code is empty, our implementation will
parse the JSON for members, and then issue the PR request:</p>

NodeJS has a standard library module called <code>util</code>, which includes
useful utility functions, as you might expect from the name.
One of them is <code>inspect</code>, which will dig into an object and
create a pretty printed view. If we use this module and <code>console.log</code>
we can see the full contents of a live response object passed into our

we need to secure the webhook. GitHub signs your data inside the

really came from an authorized host. We need to decode it inside our

provides inside the request headers. Then, we will need to calculate
the hash ourselves using the secret we maintain internally. If these

<p>The signature is a <em>hash message authentication code</em> (HMAC). HMAC
cryptography is vulnerable to timing attacks. When you use this
encryption technique, the time it takes to complete a comparison of
the computed hash and the sent hash can be the starting point for an attacker to gain
forced access to a server. More specifically to JavaScript, naive
comparison operators like <code>==</code> will leak this timing information.
To eliminate the risk that this information could be used to
compromise the host system, we use a module called <code>secure-compare</code>
that obscures this timing information when making a comparison. To
load this module, we need to add it to our <em>package.json</em> manifest file

<p>You&#8217;ll notice we moved the secret out of the JSON and into the
headers. This is the same structure our Hubot will see when the
GitHub webhook encodes the content of the JSON and provides us with a
secure hash in the HTTP_X_HUB_SIGNATURE key. Inside our test we will need
to provide the same signature inside our mocked request object. We
could duplicate our secure hash generation code from the
handler implementation, or we could be lazy and just run our tests
once (knowing they will fail this time), watch for the
console.log output that says "Hash: cd970490d83c&#8230;&#8203;" and copy this
hash into our mocked request object. Once we do this, our tests will
pass.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, after reloading our Hubot, if we issue a pull request using our
issue-pull-request.sh script, we should see the matching
hashes. But we won&#8217;t (at least if you used the same <em>package.json</em>
file as we specified earlier) because of a critical bug inside of Hubot
at the time of this writing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we mentioned earlier, Hubot bundles Express.js, a high-performance
web framework for NodeJS. Express.js has a modular architecture, where
middleware is inserted into a request and response chain. This
approach to building functionality and the wide array of middleware
allows web developers to string together various standardized
middleware components to use only those features needed for the
problem at hand. Common middleware includes static file handlers (for
serving static files), cookie handlers, session handlers, and body
parsers. You can imagine circumstances where you would not need all of
these (or you might need others) and this flexibility makes
Express.js a popular choice for building NodeJS web applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The body parser middleware is of particular interest to us here: the
body parser middleware is used to convert the "body" of a request into
a JavaScript object attached to the request object. Previously you saw us
access it inside a variable we called <code>req</code> inside our callback;
obviously this stands for request. The body parser takes on converting
whatever data content comes from inside the body of the HTTP request into a
structured JavaScript associative array inside the <code>body</code> object within our
request object. If the body is URL encoded (as the PR information is
encoded if we create the webhook with the <code>content_type</code> set to
<code>form</code>), then the body parser URL decodes the content, parses it as
JSON, and then sets the inflated object to the body attribute on our
request object. Normally, this is a very handy process that removes a
lot of grunt work for web application authors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Unfortunately, because the <code>express</code> object is bundled and configured for us long
before our extension is loaded, we cannot interrupt the load order of
the body parser middleware inside our extension, which means we
cannot get access to the raw body content. The body parser middleware
processes the stream of
data by registering for events inside the HTTP request flow. NodeJS
made a mark on web application development by providing a network
application toolkit centered around one of the
most controversial features of JavaScript: the asynchronous
callback. In NodeJS, processes register for events and then return
control to the host program. In other languages, like Ruby, for
example, when building services that receive data from clients, by
default, you listen for incoming data, and the moment you tell your
program to listen, you have blocked other processing. Asynchronous
programming is by no means a new concept (threading in many languages,
for example), but NodeJS offers a simple way to interact with
asynchronous functions through event registration. In the case of
express middleware, however, this event registration process bites us,
because middleware loaded first gets first access to incoming data,
and once the body parser has processed our body content, we can no longer access the original content. We need access to the raw body
content, and there is no way to install our own middleware that would
provide it inside our Hubot extension when a PR request is received
on the router.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What options do we have then? Well, fortunately, every bit of our
stack here is open source, and we can modify the code inside Hubot
that sets up our express server to fit our needs. This code is
installed by the <code>npm</code> tool in the <em>node_modules</em> directory, and we
can easily find where express is configured inside of Hubot. There are
issues with doing it this way: if we rerun <code>npm install</code> we will blow
away our <em>node_modules</em> directory, and this is something Heroku will
do if it is not told otherwise. A better way might be to fork Hubot
and store our own copy of Hubot inside of GitHub and then specify our
forked copy inside of the <em>package.json</em>? file. This has issues too; if
Hubot gets updated with a critical security flaw, we need to merge
those changes into our fork, a maintenance issue we would avoid
if we use tagged releases from the main repository. There is,
unfortunately, no perfect way to resolve this problem that does not
itself create other problems.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do choose to modify the built-in Hubot code, modify the file
<em>robot.coffee</em> inside the <em>node_modules/hubot/src/</em> directory. The
<em>node_modules</em> directory, in case memory fails, is where the NodeJS
package manager (npm) builds out the local dependency tree for
libraries, and this is the file Hubot uses internally to build the
robot object and set up the express HTTP server. If we add the
following code at line 288 (this line number might vary if you are not
using the same version of Hubot we specify in our <em>package.json</em>), we
can install a custom middleware callback that will provide us with
the raw body we can use when verifying the HMAC signature:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript">...
app.use (req, res, next) =&gt;
  res.setHeader "X-Powered-By", "hubot/#{@name}"
  next()

app.use (req, res, next) =&gt;
  req.rawBody = ''
  req.on 'data', (chunk) -&gt;
    req.rawBody += chunk
  next()

app.use express.basicAuth user, pass if user and pass
app.use express.query()

...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Express middleware have a very simple interface: they are nothing more
than a JavaScript function callback that receives a request, response,
and continuation function passed as parameters. We
register a listener when data content (the body) is propagated, and
then add the body content to a variable on the request object. When
the request object is passed in to our handler for pull requests within
our Hubot, we have the raw data prefilled. The <code>next()</code> function is
used to indicate to the middleware host that the next middleware can
proceed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now need to adjust our tests to fit this new requirement. We prime
the pump with a request object that has this <code>rawBody</code> inside
it, and we should properly encode the content using
<code>encodeURIComponent</code> to match the format in which it will be appearing
from GitHub:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript">...

        bodyPayload = "payload=#{encodeURIComponent(payload)}"
        req = { rawBody: bodyPayload,
        headers: { "x-hub-signature" : \
		 "sha1=dc827de09c5b57da3ee54dcfc8c5d09a3d3e6109" } }

        expect( robot.messageRoom ).toHaveBeenCalled()

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our implementation breaks our tests, so we will need to modify the
cost to use the <code>rawBody</code> attribute on the request object, break it
apart from the payload key/value pair, URI decode it, and then if all
that works, parse the JSON and start the verification process. Our
tests describe all this for us. The new <code>prHandler</code> method looks like
this:</p>

        res.send "OK\n"

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When all is said and done, is verifying the signature even worth it?
If we are not hosting our Hubot on a service that handles our router
requests over HTTPS, this HMAC verification could be compromised. And,
given the issues with maintaining our own copy of the Hubot code in
order to permit the validation inside our Hubot extension, it might be
best to ignore the validation header. The worst case, as our extension
is written now, would be that an attacker could fake a pull request
notification, and falsely engage chat room users around it. If the PR
the attacker used was fake, it might confuse our Hubot, but no real
harm would be done. If they used an existing real PR, an attacker
could trick our Hubot into adding data to the PR, adding confusion in
the comments about who accepted the review request. We won&#8217;t solve that
potential problem with this code, but you can imagine adding code to
our Hubot that handles a case like this (for example, by checking
first to see if someone was already tagged on the PR, and ignoring
successive incoming webhooks associated with that PR).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_responding_to_the_pr_request">Responding to the PR request</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our Hubot is now programmed to generate a pull request review message and
send it to a random user. What happens when they respond? They can
respond in two ways obviously: accepting the request or declining the
request. We put placeholders in our Hubot extension to notify us with
a debugging message when the user responds and send a message back to
whoever sent us a message, but now we can actually wire up handling
the response and adding to the pull request on GitHub based on the
user we are interacting with (provided they accepted).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are multiple ways in which a Hubot can interact with chat room messages. We chose the <code>respond</code> method, but there is another method called <code>hear</code> we could have used. <code>respond</code> is used when the message is preceded by the Hubot name, so only messages that look like <code>probot: accept</code> or <code>@probot decline</code> or <code>/ accept</code> (if the Hubot name alias is enabled) will be processed by our Hubot. We could have used <code>hear</code> but in our case we are processing a simple response, and without a clear direction for the message, it would be difficult to always make sure we were interpreting the message in the correct context. <code>respond</code> makes more sense here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If they decline the request, let&#8217;s just graciously note that the offer was declined:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-coffeescript" data-lang="coffeescript">...
exports.decline = ( res ) -&gt;
        res.reply "No problem, we'll go through this PR in a bug scrub"

...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We are asking someone to accept a pull request, and there is a possible
situation where two could come in within a very short period of
time. For this reason, it probably makes sense for us to indicate the
pull request identifier in the communication with the target
user. And, users should be told to reply with a string like <code>accept
112</code>. The Hubot can then interpret this to mean they are accepting PR
#112 and not the other pull request the Hubot invited John to
respond to 10 seconds later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we do this, our Hubot does need to save the state of pull request
invitations. Fortunately, there is an extremely easy way to do this
using the "brain" of our Hubot. The brain is a persistent store,
typically backed by Redis, into which you can keep any type of
information. You simply reference the <code>robot.brain</code> and use methods
like <code>get</code> or <code>set</code> to retrieve and store information. The <code>set</code>
method takes any key and any value but note that the Hubot brain does
not do much with your value if that value happens to be a complex
object; if you want to properly serialize something beyond a flat
value, you should probably call <code>JSON.stringify</code> on the object to
maintain full control over the roundtrip storing and retrieval.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s modify our Hubot handler to deal with accepting or declining
responses (and change our extension file to deal with this new
interface). Of course, we will need to add to our tests. Finally, we
will need to set up a way to provide the GitHub API key to our Hubot
handler, so we&#8217;ll add a method to do that that looks almost exactly
like the one for setting our secret key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll use a GitHub API NodeJs module called <code>node-github</code>, found on
GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github" class="bare">https://github.com/mikedeboer/node-github</a>. If we look
at the API documentation, we see that it supports authentication using
an OAuth token (using the <code>github.<span class="keep-together">authenticate</span>( {  'type' : 'oauth': 'token' : '...' }</code> syntax), and has methods we can use to add a comment to an
issue or pull request associated with a repository (using the
<code>github.issues.createComment</code> method).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Knowing that this module handles most of the work for us between these
two methods, we can start by writing our tests. We&#8217;ll create a new
describe block called <code>#response</code> that groups our tests together. As
we noted earlier, our Hubot can take affirmative and negative
responses, so our tests should reflect these two code paths. Our setup
block (the <code>beforeEach</code> section) in both cases should do the same
thing for each response&#x2014;make the pull request invitation to a random user: this all
happens inside our <code>prHandler</code> code. We don&#8217;t need to verify the
expectations of this method since that got that covered by prior
tests. After we get our handler to the right state, we need to test
that the handler works correctly with an <code>accept</code> and <code>decline</code> method
(they don&#8217;t yet exist in our handler code so we&#8217;ll add them
next).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our accept request handler triggers our Hubot to
contact GitHub and add a comment to the pull request noting
our targeted chat user accepted the request. The network
connection to the GitHub API uses the GitHub API bindings from within
the <code>node-github</code> module. We want to make this testable, so we should pass in the
GitHub binding object inside our interface, and during the test, pass
in a mocked object. If we review the documentation for the
<code>createComment</code> in the GitHub API binding, we see it requires
information about the repository such as the user or organization
that owns the repository, the repository name, the issue number (pull
requests are also referenced by issue numbers), and the comment
itself. To get this information we simply need to decode it from the
Hubot handler that receives the pull request information, and we
will add code that does this (and is exposed in our handler for
testing). We saw that a pull request comes in through a large JSON
response, and we can use the URL we used earlier as the way we decode
this information. So, we&#8217;ll need to have two more tests inside our
<code>#response</code> block, one for the decoding of the URL into a message
object, and another to retrieve the username we insert into the
comment stored in the pull request on the repository. We know what our
test URL looks like since we saw it in our PR webhook message, but we
don&#8217;t yet have the structure of the chat message from which we can
pull out our username, so our test will need to be adjusted when we
know what it really looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Declining the request means nothing happens. If we
mock out our GitHub API binding, acceptance should log in (using the
<code>authenticate</code> method) and then call <code>createComment</code>. These are
directly pulled from the GitHub API NodeJS documentation. Finally, we
should record the result of this operation inside the chat room, which
happens using the reply method on our response object:</p>

<p>Our tests will fail if we run them now. So, let&#8217;s write the code at
the end of our delegator extension. We need code that parses the URL into the
appropriate structured message object, code to put the reminder into
the pull request comment on GitHub, and code that pulls the user out
of the response object passed to us. The first two of these are within
reach; basic JavaScript and reading the GitHub API
binding documentation will get us to these two. The third one requires a
little more investigation, so we will leave this as a placeholder for now.</p>

<p>To convert the URL into the object necessary for the <code>createMessage</code>

could add some additional tests that cover passing in empty strings,
or other edge cases, but we&#8217;ll leave it as an exercise to the
reader. Our code does not crash in these cases, but it would be
nice to have coverage of our expectations represented in our tests:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We need to get the username, and it stands to reason that the object passed
to us when we get a respond callback might have it in there. The
<code>respond</code> method provided by the Hubot API is documented mostly by
way of the example scripts that come with Hubot. There is very little
information on what the parameter passed to your callback looks
like. Let&#8217;s use the <code>util</code> library to inspect the data and print it to
the console. We abbreviate the full output here, and show you that it
contains information on the  user who sent the message to our
Hubot. We can access this information by using
<code>response.message.user.name</code> if, for example, we wanted to retrieve
the name of the user:</p>

  ...

  ...
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Inside it all we can find information we need,
specifically the username and email. So, let&#8217;s update our test and
our handler code. The last test in our spec file can be modified to
look like this:</p>

<h5 id="_unifying_usernames_via_the_collaborators_api">Unifying usernames via the Collaborators API</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the Slack username for the person who accepted the pull request is an
exact match with their GitHub username, then we can assume they are
the same person in real life and create a comment inside the pull
request reminding them (and anyone else) that they will be reviewing
the PR. We can use the collaborator subsection of the Repository API
to look up their name on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we don&#8217;t find them inside the list of users and there is not an
exact match with their Slack name then we have at least one problem,
maybe two. First, we could just have a mismatch in their identities
(their usernames are different on each site). If this is the case, we
could ask them to clarify this inside the Slack room. We do have
another case: the user is not a collaborator on the repository hosted
on GitHub. If
this is the case, clarifying their username is not going to help. The
Repository API does support adding a user to the list of collaborators
so we could do that here, but this arguably is a moment where a larger
discussion should happen (write access to a repository is a big
resposibility in a way that being inside a chat room is not). Adding a
user as a repository collaborator should not be automated inside a chat
room. Because of the complexity here, we will write code to unify a
username inside the chat room, but we won&#8217;t handle the case where
there is no clarification to be made because they are not in the
repository collaborator list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using the GitHub API binding we passed into our <code>setApiToken</code>
call we will verify the user exists as a collaborator on the
repository. The API binding provides a method called <code>getCollaborator</code>
inside the <code>repos</code> namespace we can use to verify that a
username is on the list of collaborators. It takes as the first
parameter a  message that is used to specify the repository and
owner, and then an attribute called <code>collabuser</code>, which is the name you
want to ensure is a collaborator. The second parameter to the function
is a callback that is executed once the request has completed. If the
callback returns without an error code, then our Hubot should tag the
pull request with a comment confirming and message the room.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our new test reflects usage of the <code>repos.getCollaborator</code> call. In
our test setup block we mock out the call to <code>getCollaborator</code>
and use Jasmine to "spy on" it so we can assure it was called later
in our actual test. Our setup is more beefy than before, but we are
following the same patterns of generating spies to watch methods, and
implementing our fake callbacks when necessary. We can also move our
message inside the response object into the one created in our setup
block so that we can use it inside all of our subtests, rather than
creating a new object for each test inside the test body:</p>

<p>Our Hubot is alive! We went through building a robot that can
interact with us inside a chat room, then refactored the robot so that its
functionality is contained into a highly testable module. Along
the way, we got intimate with the Hubot API, and even discussed how to
modify (and the drawbacks surrounding) modifying the source code to
Hubot itself. Finally, we demonstrated how to use the Activity API
receiving (and faking data) coming from a GitHub webhook.</p>

<p>You might not use your phone right now as a developer tool, but the
odds are that you will soon. At the moment, phones and tablets can be
great for reading code, but the editors we developers use on our
laptops have not yet been reimagined for mobile devices. We are
getting close though: the GitHub API is accessible through the well-written EGit client library for Java, and this library supports both reading
data stored on GitHub and writing data back into it. These are a
perfect set of building blocks to develop applications for the Android
platform, currently the world&#8217;s most popular mobile OS.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, we&#8217;ll use the Java EGit libraries to develop a small

<p>We are writing an application that adds Jekyll blog entries, and we

we need a sandbox blog against which we can run commands. There are
various ways to create a new Jekyll blog. The simplest is to run a
series of Ruby commands documented here; if you want to know more
about Jekyll, it is covered in more depth in <a href="#Jekyll">Ruby and Jekyll</a>.
There are a few items of note when establishing a Jekyll blog that
have some complexity, things like mapping a hostname properly and using the
correct branch inside Git. For our purposes here, however, we won&#8217;t need
to make sure all that is established. All we need is to make sure
we have a sandbox repository that has the structure of a Jekyll blog:</p>

$ export BLOG_NAME=mytestblog
$ bundle
$ jekyll new $BLOG_NAME
$ cd $BLOG_NAME
$ hub create
$ git push -u origin master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These commands install the correct libraries for using Jekyll (and one
for our tests as well), generate a new blog using the Jekyll command-line tool, and then create a blog on GitHub with those files. On the
second line we specify the name of the blog; you are welcome to change
this to any name you&#8217;d like, just make sure the tests match the name.</p>

should occur in a fresh directory and as such it is best not to run
those commands from within the same directory where you created your

Java is freely available, but you need to visit <a class="orm:hideurl" href="http://java.oracle.com"><em>java.oracle.com</em></a> and

create a new project. Click the "Start a new Android Studio
project" option. In the next step, you will see a screen for
configuring your new project. Enter GhRU ("GitHub R U?") into the
Application Name and use <em>example.com</em> as the Company Domain (or use
your own domain, but be aware that this will make the directory structure
presented in this chapter different than yours). Android Studio should
automatically generate the "package name" for you as
<code>com.example.ghru</code>.</p>

<p>You will then need to choose a target SDK. The higher the target,
the better access to newer Android APIs, but the fewer number of
devices that can run the application. The code in this chapter will
work with older SDKs, so let&#8217;s make a balanced choice and use Android
4.4 (KitKat), which runs on phones and tablets. At the moment this means,
according to Android Studio, that our application will run on 49.5% of
Android devices in the world as shown in <a href="#choose-android-sdk">Choose an Android SDK</a>.</p>

contains, quite obviously, any Java code for the project, which
includes the application files, and also programs that do not reside
in the app when it is published to the app store but perform testing
on the app. The <em>res</em> directory contains the resources we
mentioned. Android Studio lists all build files under the Gradle
Scripts section, and groups them regardless of their directory
placement. You can see two <em>build.gradle</em> files, the first of which
you can generally ignore, though the second we will need to adjust.</p>

<p>First, we load the Android gradle plug-in. This extends our project
to allow an <code>android</code> block, which we specify next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we configure our android block, with things like the target
version (which we choose when setting up our project) and the actual
SDK, which we are using to compile the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In order to run UI tests, we need to specify a test runner
called the <code>AndroidJ<span class="keep-together">Unit</span>Runner</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Android Studio automatically adds a configuration to our build
file that loads any JARS (Java libraries) from the <em>lib</em>
directory. We also install the support compatibility library for older
Android devices, and most importantly, the EGit library that manages
connections to GitHub for us. The commons CODEC library from the
Apache Foundation provides tools that help to encode content into
Base64, one of the options for storing data inside a GitHub repository
using the API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we install libraries that are only used when we run unit
tests. <code>testCompile</code> libraries are compiled only when the code is run
on the local development machine, and for this situation we need the
JUnit library, and the OkHttp library from Square, which helps us
validate that our request for a new commit has made it all the way
into the GitHub API.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lastly, we install the Espresso libraries, the Google UI testing
framework. The first line (of the three libraries) installs the test
runner we configured earlier. We use <code>androidTestCompile</code>, which
compiles against these libraries when the code runs on Android in test
mode.</p>

<em>AndroidManifest.xml</em>, which specifies this activity and also supplies
a list of permissions to the apps. Open the <em>AndroidManifest.xml</em> file
from within the <em>app/src/main</em> directory. We need to make one change: to
add a line that specifies that this app will use the Internet
permission (required if our app will be talking to the GitHub
API). Note that when viewing this file inside Android Studio the IDE
can interpolate strings from resources, so you might see the
<code>android:label</code> attribute displayed as GhRU with a grey tinge, when
in fact the XML file itself has the value displayed here (<code>@string/app_name</code>):</p>

<h3 id="_android_automated_testing">Android Automated Testing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Android supports three types of tests: unit tests, integration tests,
and user interface (UI) tests. Unit tests validate very tightly
defined and isolated pieces of code, while integration tests and UI tests test
larger pieces of the whole. On Android, integration tests generally
mean instantiation of data managers or code that interacts with
multiple components inside the app, while UI testing permits testing
of user-facing elements like buttons or text fields.
In this chapter we will create a unit test and a UI test.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important note: Unit tests run on your development machine, not the Android
device itself. UI tests run on the Android device (or emulator). There
can be subtle differences between the Java interpreter running on your development
machine and the Dalvik interpreter running on your Android device, so
it is worthwhile to use a mixture of the three types of tests. Stated
another way, write at least one test that runs on the device or
emulator itself!</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_unit_tests_for_our_github_client">Unit Tests for Our GitHub Client</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start by defining a unit test. Since the unit test runs on our
development machine, our test and implementation code should be
written such that they do not need to load any Android classes. This
forces us to constrain functionality to only the GitHub API. We will
define a helper class that will handle all the interaction with the
GitHub API but does not know about Android whatsoever. Then, we can
write a test harness that takes that class, instantiates it, and
validates our calls to GitHub produce the right results.</p>

You might legitimately ask: is a unit test the right place to verify
an API call? Will this type of test be fast, given that slow-running
unit tests are quickly ignored by software developers? Would it be
better to mock out the response data inside our unit tests? These are
all good questions!
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To set up unit tests, we need to switch the build variant to unit
tests. Look for a vertical tab on the lefthand side of Android
Studio. Click this, and then where it says "Test Artifact" switch
to "Unit Tests." From the project view (click the "Project" vertical tab if
project view is not already selected) you can expand the "java"
directory, and you should then see a directory with "(test)" in
parentheses indicating this is where tests go. If this directory is
not there, create a directory using the command line (this command
would work: <code>mkdir -p app/src/test/java/com/example/ghru</code>).</p>

<li>
<p>First, we import the OkHttp library, a library for making HTTP
calls. We will verify that our GitHub API calls made it all the way into
GitHub by looking at the event log for our repository, a log
accessible via HTTP.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we import JUnit, which provides us with an annotation
<code>@Test</code> we can use to indicate to a test runner that certain methods
are test functions (and should be executed as tests when in test mode).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We create a class called <code>GitHubHelperTest</code>. In it, we define a
sole test case <code>testClient</code>. We use the <code>@Test</code> annotation to indicate
to JUnit that this is a test case.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now we specify our login information and the repository we want to
test against. In order to keep the password out of our source code, we
use an environment variable we can specify when we run the
tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we build a random string. This unique string will be our
commit message, a beacon that allows us to verify that our commit made it
all the way through and was stored on GitHub, and to differentiate it from
other commits made recently by other tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, to the meat of the test: we instantiate our GitHub helper class
with login credentials, then use the <code>SaveFile</code> function to save the
file. The last parameter is our commit message, which we will verify
later.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There can be times when the GitHub API has registered the commit
but the event is not yet displayed in results coming back from the
API; sleeping for a few seconds fixes this.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, we go through the steps to make an HTTP call with the OkHttp
library. We load a URL that provides us with the events for a
specified repository, events that will have the commit message when
it is a push type event. This repository happens to be public so we
don&#8217;t require authentication against the GitHub API to see this data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we have the body of the HTTP call, we can scan it to verify
the commit message is there.</p>

<li>
<p>We import the instrumentation registry (for instrumenting the
tests of our app), the base class, and matchers that will be used to
make assertions in our tests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We create a test class that derives from the
<code>ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2</code> generic.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The constructor of an Espresso test implementation needs to call
the parent constructor with the class of the activity for test, in
this case <code>MainActivity</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our test verifies that we can log in to GitHub, so we name it accordingly.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then load the instrumentation registry, and also call
<code>getActivity</code>, which actually instantiates and starts the activity. In
many Espresso tests these two steps will occur in a function annotated as
a <code>@Before</code> function if they are used across multiple tests (in which
case they will be run before each test). Here to simplify our function
count we can call them inside the single test function.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is never a good idea to store credentials inside of a code
repository, so we retrieve the username and  password from a resource
XML file using the <code>getString</code> function available using the
activity. We will show what the contents of this secret file could
look like presently.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once we have the username, we can enter it in the text field in
our UI. With the <code>onView</code> function we can interact with a view (for
example: a button or text field). <code>withId</code> finds the view using the
resource identifier inside the XML layout files. Once we have the
view, we can then perform an action (using the <code>perform</code> function)
like typing in text. This chain of calls enters the GitHub username
into the first text field.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then complete our interaction with the UI, entering in the
password and then clicking the login button.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If all is successful, we should see the text "Logged into
GitHub." Under the hood, this test will verify that we are logged in to
GitHub and display the successful result.</p>

<p>To provide a username and password to our test and to keep these

<p>The context in which the code runs makes as much of a difference as the
code. The Android OS disallows any code from making network
connections unless it runs inside a background thread.
If you are not a Java developer already, and the thought of using
threads with Java sounds daunting, dispell your worries. The
Android SDK provides a great class for managing background tasks
called <code>AsyncTask</code>. This class provides several entry points into the
lifecycle of a thread that is managed by the Android OS. We implement
a class and then override two functions provided by <code><span class="keep-together">Async</span>Task</code>: the
first function is <code>doInBackground()</code>, which handles operations off the
main thread (our background thread code), and the second function is
<code>onPost<span class="keep-together">Execute()</span></code>, which runs on the UI thread and allows us to update
the UI with the results of the code that ran inside <code>doInBackground()</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we implement the login, we need to update our <code>onCreate</code>
function of the <code>MainActivity</code>. Our login button handles logging in,
so let&#8217;s register a click handler on the login button that will call
the login task we will define inside our class based off <code><span class="keep-together">Async</span>Task</code>:</p>

<li>
<p>Here we define our class derived from AsyncTask. You see three
types in the generics signature: <code>String</code>, <code>Void</code>, and
<code>Boolean</code>. These are the parameters to our entry point, an
intermediate callback and the final callback, which returns control to
the calling thread. The first type allows us to parameterize our
instantiated task; we need to provide a username and password to the
background task, and the first type in the signature allows us to pass
an array of Strings. You can see in the actual function definition
that the ellipsis notation provides a way to parameterize a function
with a variable number of arguments (called varargs). Inside our
defined function we expect we will send two Strings in, and we make
sure to do that in our call.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once inside the <code>doInBackground()</code> function, we instantiate a
<code>UserService</code> class, a wrapper around the GitHub API, which interacts
with the user service API call. In order to access this information,
we have to retrieve the client for this service call and provide the
client with the username and password credentials. This is the syntax
to do that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We wrap the call to <code>getUser()</code> in a try block as the function
signature can throw an error (if the network were down, for example).
We don&#8217;t really need to retrieve information about the user using the
User object, but this call verifies that our username and password are
correct, and we store this result in our return value.
GitHub will not use the credentials you set until you make an API
call, so we need to use our credentials to access something in order
to verify that those credentials work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let&#8217;s call our function <code>loggedIn()</code> instead of <code>login()</code> to more
accurately reflect the fact that when we call this, we are already
logged in to GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If our login was a failure, either because of network failure, or
because our credentials were incorrect, we indicate this in the status
message. A user can retry if they wish.</p>

exactly as expected, so set the expectation to false to start. The
value of our return statement is passed to the next stage in the
lifecycle of the thread, a function called <code>onPostExecute</code> (an
optional stage in the thread lifecycle we will use to report
status of the operation back to the user).</p>

<p>Now, we instantiate the <code>GitHubHelper</code> class. This instantiation

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_code_to_talk_to_github">Code to Talk to GitHub</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Our last step is to write the code that handles putting content into GitHub.
This is not a simple function, because the GitHub API requires you
build out the structure used internally by Git. A great reference for learning more about
this structure is the free and open-source book called <a href="https://progit.org/"><em>Pro Git</em></a> and
specifically the last chapter called
<a href="http://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Internals">Git Internals</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In a nutshell, the GitHub
API expects you to create a Git "tree" and then place a "blob" object
into that tree. You then wrap the tree in a "commit" object and then
create that commit on GitHub using a data service wrapper. In
addition, writing a tree into GitHub requires knowing the base SHA
identifier, so you&#8217;ll see code that retrieves the last SHA in the
tree associated with our current branch. This code will work
regardless of whether we are pushing code into the master branch, or
into the gh-pages branch, so this utility class works with real
Jekyll blogs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll write a helper class called <code>GitHubHelper</code> and add a single
function that writes a file to our repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub API requires that files stored in repositories be
either Base64 encoded or UTF-8. The Apache Foundation provides a suite of tools
published to Maven (the same software repository where we grabbed the
EGit libraries), which can do this encoding for us, and which were
already installed in our Gradle file previously (the "commons-codec" declaration).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will start by defining a series of high-level functions inside
<code>SaveFile</code> to get through building a commit inside of GitHub. Each
function itself contains some complexity so let&#8217;s look first at the
overview of what it takes to put data into GitHub using the Git Data API:</p>

<p>You will notice many similarities between this Java code and the
Ruby code we used in <a href="#Jekyll">Ruby and Jekyll</a> when generating filenames
and escaping whitespace.</p>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>First, we set up several instance variables we will use when
storing the data into GitHub: the commit message, the full post
including the YAML Front Matter (YFM), the post contents encoded as
Base64, the filename, and then the three parameters we saved from the
call to <code>SaveFile()</code>: the post itself, the title, and the
repository name.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>generateContent</code> function creates the necessary components for our
new post: the full content Base64 encoded, and the filename we will
use to store the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Here we create the YAML Front Matter (see <a href="#Jekyll">Ruby and Jekyll</a> for more
details on YFM). This YAML specifies the "post" layout and sets
publishing to "true." We need to terminate the YAML with two newlines.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Base64 encodes the contents of the blog post
itself using a utility class found inside the Apache Commons
library. Contents inside a Git repository are stored either as UTF-8
content or Base64; we could have used UTF-8 since this is text content
but Base64 works losslessly, and you can always safely use Base64
without concerning yourself about the content.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, inside <code>getFilename()</code>, create the title by using the first
30 characters of the post.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Convert the title to lowercase, and replace the whitespace with
hyphens to get the Jekyll post title format.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jekyll expects the date to be formatted as <code>yyyy-MM-dd</code>, so use
the java <code>SimpleDateFormat</code> class to help create a string of that format.</p>
</li>

<p>Finally, create the filename from all these pieces, prepending
<code>_posts</code> to the filename, where Jekyll expects posts to reside.</p>

acyclic graph (DAG) and as such, (almost) every node in the graph points
to another commit (or potentially two if it is a merge commit). When
we append content to our graph, we need to determine the prior node in
that graph and attach the new node. <code>retrieve<span class="keep-together">Base</span>Sha</code> does this: it
finds the SHA hash for our last commit, a SHA hash that is
functionally an address inside our tree. To determine this address,
our application needs to have a reference to the repository, and we
use the repository service we instantiated earlier to get this
reference. Once we have the repository, we need to look inside the
correct branch: <code>getBranch</code> does this for us:</p>

repository name and a base SHA address, one that we retrieved earlier,
to validate that this is a valid starting point inside our
repository. Once we have a tree, we fill out the necessary tree
attributes, like tree type (blob) and
tree mode (blob), and set the SHA from the previously created blob
