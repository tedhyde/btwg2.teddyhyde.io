  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>Building Tools with GitHub</em> is a beagle, a small- to medium-sized breed of dog (<em>Canis familiaris</em>). The modern beagle breed was developed in Great Britain in the 1830s, and was originally created to track small game animals, such as rabbits. Hunting by using beagles to track prey is known as &#x201c;beagling.&#x201d;</p>
 <p>Beagles are part of the hound family of dog breeds, but compared to other hounds beagles are small, with shorter legs and snouts. Beagles are most commonly tricolored (white, black, and brown), but can occasionally be found with only two of the three colors.</p>
<p>Beagles are well-regarded as household pets because of their even demeanor and high intelligence. They have made appearances in popular culture since Elizabethan times, from the works of Shakespeare to modern cartoon strips.</p>
