<p>The Jekyll project calls itself a "blog-aware, static site generator
in Ruby." At its core, Jekyll is a very simple set of
technologies for building web sites. Simplicity is what gives Jekyll
its power: using Jekyll you will never have to learn about database
backends, complicated server installations or any of the myriad
processes involved with most monolithic web site technologies. Many
prominent technical bloggers use Jekyll as their blogging platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many of the open source technologies in heavy usage at GitHub,
Jekyll was originally developed by Tom Preson Warner, one of the
co-founders of GitHub, and Nick Quaranto, of 37 Signals, though there
are now thousands of contributors to the Jekyll codebase.
Unsurprisingly, the strength of the Jekyll tool comes not from the
brilliance of the original developers or the brilliance of the idea,
but the way that those original developers cultivated community and
involvement among their users.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_learning_and_building_with_jekyll">Learning and Building with Jekyll</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter we will investigate the structure of a Jekyll blog,
illustrating the few major technology pieces involved. Once we have
familiarized ourselves with Jekyll, we will then create a Jekyll blog
from scratch using the command line tools. Then we will write a Ruby
program which scrapes a blog-like website and converts the scraped
information into a new Jekyll blog.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_what_is_jekyll">What is Jekyll?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jekyll specifies a file structure format: conform to this format and
Jekyll will compile your files into HTML. Jekyll builds on top of two
proven tools: Markdown, a markup language which is surprisingly
readable and expressive, and Liquid Markup, a simple programming language which
gives you just enough components to build modern web
pages requiring conditionals and loops, but safe enough that you can
run untrusted pages on public servers. With these two technologies and
agreement on a layout structure, Jekyll can build very complicated web
sites paradoxically without requiring a complicated structure of files
and technologies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jekyll works natively with GitHub because a Jekyll blog is
stored as a Git repository. When you push files into GitHub from a
repository which GitHub recognizes as a Jekyll site, GitHub
automatically rebuilds the site for you.
Jekyll is an open source generator and defines a format for your
source files, a format which other tools can easily understand and
operate upon. This means you can build your own tools to interact with
a Jekyll blog. Combining an open source tool like Jekyll with a well
written API like the GitHub API makes for some powerful publishing
tools.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_operating_jekyll_locally">Operating Jekyll Locally</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To really use jekyll, you’ll need the <code>jekyll</code> gem. As we explain in
the <a href="#appendix">[appendix]</a>, we could install a ruby gem using this command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ gem install jekyll</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two issues with doing installation this way. The first is that any
commands we run inside the command line are lost to us and the world
(other than in our private shell history file). The second is that if
we are going to publish any of our sites to GitHub, we will want to
make sure we are matching the exact versions of Jekyll and its
dependencies so that a site that works on our local laptop also works
when published into GitHub. If you don’t take care of this, you’ll
occasionally get an email like this from GitHub:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code> The page build failed with the following error:

 page build failed

 For information on troubleshooting Jekyll see
 https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-with-pages#troubleshooting
 If you have any questions please contact GitHub Support.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The fix for these two issues is a simple one. You’ve probably seen other
chapters using a <code>Gemfile</code> to install ruby libraries. Instead of
using a manual command like <code>bundle</code> to install from the command line,
let’s put this dependency into the Gemfile. Then, anyone else using
this repository can run the command <code>bundle install</code> and install the
correct dependencies. And, instead of using the <code>jekyll</code> gem directly, use the
<code>github-pages</code> gem which synchronizes your jekyll gem versions with
those on GitHub. If you do get the email above, run the command <code>bundle update</code>
to make sure that everything is properly setup and synchronized and
generally this will reproduce the issues on your local setup, which is
a much faster place to fix them.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ printf "gem 'github-pages' &gt;&gt; Gemfile
$ bundle install</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Creating and managing your dependencies inside a Gemfile is the smart
way to get your jekyll tool synced with the version running on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we are ready to create a Jekyll blog.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_jekyll_blog_quick_start">Jekyll Blog Quick Start</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We have our required tools installed, so let’s create a simple blog. Run
these commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ jekyll new myblog
$ cd myblog</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>jekyll new</code> commands creates the necessary structure for a
minimal jekyll blog. Taking a look inside the directory, you’ll see a
few files which comprise the structure of a basic Jekyll blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>jekyll new</code> command installs two CSS files: one for
the blog (<code>main.css</code>) and one for syntax highlighting (<code>syntax.css</code>).
Remember, you are in full control of this site; the <code>main.css</code> file is
simply boilerplate which you can completely throw away if it does not
suit your needs. The syntax file helps when including code snippets
and contains syntax highlighting CSS which prettifies many programming
languages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Installation of a new blog
comes with a .gitignore file as well which contains one entry:
<code>_site</code>. When you use the jekyll library to build your site locally,
all files are by default built into the _site directory.
This .gitignore file prevents those files from being included inside
your repository as they are overwritten by the jekyll command on
GitHub when your files are pushed up to GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>jekyll new</code> command does not create or initialize a new git
repository for you with your files. If you want to do this, you will need to
use the <code>git init</code> command. The jekyll initialization command does create the
proper structure for you to easily add all files to a git repository;
just use <code>git add .; git commit</code> and your gitignore file will be added
and configure your repository to ignore unnecessary files like the
<code>_site</code> directory.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All your blog posts are stored in the <code>_posts</code> directory. Jekyll sites
are not required to have a <code>_posts</code> directory (you can use jekyll with
any kind of static site) but if you do include files in this directory
jekyll handles them in a special way. If you look in the <code>_posts</code>
directory now, you see that the jekyll initialization command has
created your first post for you, something like
<code>_posts/2014-03-03-welcome-to-jekyll.Markdown</code>. These posts have a
special naming format: the title of the post (with any whitespace replaced with
hyphens) trailed by the date and then an extension (either <code>.Markdown</code>
or <code>.md</code> for Markdown files, or <code>.textile</code> for Textile)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your new jekyll blog also comes with a few HTML files: an <code>index.html</code> file
which is the starting point for your blog, and several layout files
which are used as wrappers when generating your content. If you look
in the <code>_layouts</code> directory, notice there is a file named
<code>default.html</code> and another named <code>post.html</code>. These files are the
layout files, files which are wrapped around all generated content,
like those from your Markdown formatted blog posts. For
example, the <code>post.html</code> file is wrapped around the generated content
of each file stored inside the <code>_posts</code> directory. First the markup content is
turned into HTML and then the layout wrapper is applied. If you look
inside each of the files inside the <code>_layouts</code> directory, you will see
that each contains a placeholder with <code>{{ content }}</code>. This
placeholder is replaced with the generated content from other files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These placeholders are actually a markup language on their own:
"Liquid Markup." Liquid Markup was developed and open sourced by
Shopify.com. Liquid Markup arose from a desire to have a safe way
to host programmatic constructs (like loops and variables) inside a
template, without exposing the rendering context
to a full fledged programming environment. Shopify wanted to build a
way for untrusted users of their public facing systems to upload
dynamic content but not worry that the markup language would permit
malicious activity; for example, given a full fledged embedded
programming language, they would open themselves to attack if a user
wrote code to open network connections to sites on their internal
networks. Templating languages like PHP or ERB (embedded ruby
templates, popular with the Ruby on Rails framework) allow fully
embedded code snippets and while this is very powerful when you have full control
over your source documents, it can be dangerous to provide a mechanism
where that embedded code could look like <code>system("rm -rf /")</code>.
Liquid Markup provides many of the benefits of embedded programming templates,
without the dangers. We will show several examples of Liquid Markup
and how they work later in the chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, your jekyll directory has a special file called <code>_config.yml</code>.
This is the jekyll configuration file. Peering into it, you’ll see it
is very basic:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">name: Your New Jekyll Site
markdown: redcarpet
highlighter: pygments</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We only have three lines to contend with and they are simple to
understand: the name of our site, the Markdown parser used by our
jekyll command, and whether to use <code>pygments</code> to do syntax highlighting.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To view this site locally run this command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ jekyll serve</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command builds the entirety of your Jekyll directory, and then
starts a mini web server to serve the files up to you. If you then
visit <em><a href="http://localhost:4000" class="bare">http://localhost:4000</a></em> in your web browser, you will see
something on the front page of your site and a single blog post listed in
the index, as shown in <a href="#bare-jekyll-site">A bare Jekyll site</a>.</p>

<p>Clicking into the link inside the "Blog Posts" section, you will then
see your first post, as in <a href="#a-sample-post">A sample post</a>.</p>

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully you’ll agree this is a fairly intuitive and readable
alternative to raw HTML. This simplicity and readability is one of the
major benefits of using Jekyll. Your source files maintain a
readability that allows you to focus on the content itself, not on the
technology that will eventually make them beautiful. Let’s go over
this file and investigate some of the important pieces.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_yfm_yaml_front_matter">YFM: YAML Front Matter</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing we see in a Jekyll file is the YAML Front
Matter (YFM).</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">---
layout: post
title:  "Welcome to Jekyll!"
date:   2014-03-03 12:56:40
categories: jekyll update
---</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>YFM is a snippet of YAML ("YAML Aint Markup Language")
delimited by three hyphens on both the top and bottom. YAML is a simple structured
data serialization language used by many open source projects instead
of XML. Many people find it more readable and editable by humans
than XML. The YFM in this file shows a few configuration options: a
layout, the title, the date and a list of categories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The layout specified references one of the files in our <code>_layouts</code>
directory. If you don’t specify a layout file in the YFM, then Jekyll
assumes you want to use a file called <code>default.html</code> to wrap your
content. You can easily imagine adding your own custom layout files
to this directory and then overriding them in the YFM. If you look at
this file, you see that it manually specifies the <code>post</code> layout.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The title is used to generate the <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag and can be used
anywhere else you need it inside your template using the double
braces syntax from Liquid Markup: <code>{{ page.title }}</code>. Notice that any
variable from the <code>_config.yml</code> file is prefixed with the <code>site.</code>
namespace, while variables from your YFM are prefixed with <code>page.</code>.
Though the title matches the filename (after replacing
spaces with hyphens), changing the title in the YFM does not affect
the name of the URL generated by Jekyll. If you want to change the URL, you need to
rename the file itself. This is a nice benefit if you need to slightly modify the
title and don’t want to damage preexisting URLs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The date and categories are two other variables included in the YFM.
They are completely optional and strangely unused by the structure and
templates created by default using the Jekyll initializer. They do
provide additional context to the post, but are only stored in the
Markdown file and not included inside the generated content itself.
The categories list is often used to generate an index file of
categories with a list of each post included in a category. If you
come from a Wordpress background, you’ll likely have used categories.
These are generated dynamically from the MySQL database each time you
request a list of them, but in Jekyll this file is staticly generated.
If you wanted something more dynamic, you could imagine generating a
JSON file with these categories and files, and then building a
JavaScript widget which requests this file and then does something
more interactive on the client side. Jekyll can take any template file
and convert it to JSON (or any other format) — you are not limited to
just generating HTML files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>YFM is completely optional. A post or page can be rendered into your
Jekyll site without any YFM inside it. Without YFM, your page is
rendered using the defaults for those variables, so make sure the
default template, at the very least, is what you expect will wrap
around all pages left with unspecified layouts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One important default variable for YFM is the published variable. This
variable is set to true by default. This means that if you create a
file in your Jekyll repository and do not manually specify the
published setting, it will be published automatically. If you set the
variable to false then the post will not be published. With
private repositories you can keep the contents of draft posts entirely
private until writing has completed by making sure published is set
to false. Unfortunately, not all tools that help you create Jekyll
Markdown files remember to set the published variable explicitly
inside of YFM, so make sure you check before committing the file to
your repository if there is something you don’t yet want published.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_jekyll_markup">Jekyll Markup</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Going past the YFM, we can start to see the structure of
Markdown files. Markdown files can be, at their simplest, just textual
information without any formatting characters. In fact, if your layout files are
well done, you can definitely create great blog posts without any
fancing formatting, just pure textual content.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But, with a few small Markdown additions, you can really make posts
shine. One of the first Markdown components we notice is the backtick
character, which is used to wrap small spans of code (or code-ish
information, like filenames in this case). As you use more and more
Markdown, you’ll find Markdown to be insidiously clever in the way it
provides formatting characters without the onerous weight that HTML
requires to offer the same explicit formatting.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml">Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyll's GitHub repo][jekyll-gh].

[jekyll-gh]: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Links can be specified using <code>[format][link]</code>, where <code>link</code> is the
fully qualified URL (like "http://example.com"), or a reference to a
link at the bottom of the page. In our page we have two references,
keyed as <code>jekyll-gh</code> and <code>jekyll</code>; we can then use these inside our
page with syntax like <code>[Jekyll’s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]</code>. Using
references has an additional benefit in that you can use the link more
than once by its short name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though not offered in the sample, Markdown provides an easy way to
generate headers of varying degrees. To add a header, use the <code><mark></mark></code>
character, and repeat the <code></code> character to build smaller headers.
These delimiters simply map to the H tag; two hash characters <code><mark></mark></code>
turns into a <code>&lt;h2&gt;</code> tag. Building text enclosed by <code>&lt;h3&gt;</code> tags looks
like <code># Some Text</code>. You can optionally match the same number of hash
symbols at the end of the line if you find it more expressive (<code><mark>#
Some Text </mark>#</code>), but you don’t have to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Markdown offers easy shortcuts for most HTML elements: numbered and
unordered lists, emphasis and more. And, if you cannot find a
Markdown equivalent, you can embed normal HTML right next to
Markdown formatting characters. The best way to write Markdown is to
keep a
<a href="https://github.com/adam-p/Markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet">Markdown
cheat sheet</a> near you when writing. <a href="http://daringfireball.net">John Gruber from Daring
Fireball</a> invented Markdown, and his site has a more in depth
description of the how and why of Markdown.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_using_the_jekyll_command">Using the jekyll command</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running <code>jekyll --help</code> will show you the options for running jekyll.
You already saw the <code>jekyll serve</code> command which builds the files into
the <code>_site</code> directory and then starts a webserver with its root at that directory.
If you start to use this mechanism to build your Jekyll sites then
there are a few other switches you’ll want to learn about.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are authoring and adjusting a page often, and switching back
into your browser to see what it looks like, you’ll find utility in
the <code>-w</code> switch ("watch"). This can be used to automatically
regenerate the entire site if you make changes to any of the source
files. If you edit a post file and save it, that file will be
regenerated automatically. Without the <code>-w</code> switch you would need to
kill the jekyll server, and then restart it.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock caution">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Caution</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
The jekyll watch switch does reload all HTML and markup files, but
does not reload the <code>_config.yml</code> file. If you make changes to it, you
will need to stop and restart the server.
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are running multiple Jekyll sites on the same laptop, you’ll
quickly find that the second instance of <code>jekyll serve</code> fails because
it cannot open port 4000. In this case, use <code>jekyll --port 4010</code> to
open port 4010 (or whatever port you wish to use instead).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_privacy_levels_with_jekyll">Privacy Levels with Jekyll</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jekyll repositories on GitHub can be either public or private
repositories. If your repository is public you can host public content
generated from the Jekyll source files without publishing the source
files themselves. Remember, as noted previously, that any file without
<code>publishing: false</code> inside the YFM will be made public the moment you
push it into your repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_themes">Themes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jekyll does not support theming internally, but it is trivial to add
any CSS files or entire CSS frameworks. You can also fork an existing
jekyll blog which has the theming you like. We will show how and where
to add your own customized CSS later in the chapter.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_publishing_on_github">Publishing on GitHub</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have your blog created, you can easily publish it to GitHub.
There are two ways which you can publish Jekyll blogs:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>

</li>
<li>
<p>On a domain you own</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Github offers free personal blogs which are hosted on the github.io
domain. And, you can host any site with your own domain name with a
little bit of configuration.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_using_a_github_io_jekyll_blog">Using a GitHub.io Jekyll Blog</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a github.io personal blog site, your Jekyll blog should be
on the master branch of your Git repository. The repository should be
named <code>username.github.io</code> on GitHub. If everything is setup correctly
you can then publish your Jekyll blog by adding a remote for GitHub
and pushing your files up. If you use the <code>hub</code> tool (a command for
interacting with git and GitHub), you can go from start to finish with
a few simple commands. Make sure to change the first line to reflect
your username.</p>

The <code>hub</code> tool was originally written in Ruby and as such could be
easily installed using only <code>gem instal hub</code>, but hub was recently
rewritten in Go. Go has a somewhat more complicated installation

the GitHub servers.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, establishing DNS settings for your site is straightforward.
It is easiest if you are setting up DNS with a <strong>subdomain</strong> as opposed

like mypersonaldomain.com, while a subdomain would be
blog.mypersonaldomain.com.</p>

<p>Setting up a blog on a subdomain is simple: create a CNAME record in DNS that points

<p>For an apex domain, things are slightly more complicated. You must create DNS
A records to point to these IP addresses: <code>192.30.252.153</code> and
<code>192.30.252.154</code>.  These are the IP addresses right now; there is
always the possibility that GitHub could change these at some point in
the future. For this reason, hosting on apex domains is risky. If
GitHub needed to change their IP addresses (say during a denial of
service attack), you would need to respond to this, and deal with the
DNS propagation issues. If you instead use a subdomain, the CNAME
record will automatically redirect to the correct IP even if that is
changed by GitHub <span class="footnote">[<a id="_footnoteref_1" class="footnote" href="#_footnote_1" title="View footnote.">1</a>]</span>.</p>

<p>There are many tools which can be used to import an existing blog into
Jekyll. As Jekyll is really nothing more than a file layout
convention, you just need to pull the relevant pieces (the post
itself, and associated metadata like the post title, publishing date,
etc.) and then write out a file with those contents. Jekyll blogs
prefer Markdown, but they work fine with HTML content, so you can
often convert a blog with minimal effort, and there are good tools
which automate things for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_from_wordpress">From Wordpress</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most popular importer is the Wordpress importer. You will need the
'jekyll-import' gem. This gem is distributed separately from the core
jekyll gem, but will be installed if you use the <code>github-pages</code> gem
inside your Gemfile and use the <code>bundle</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_importing_with_direct_database_access">Importing with direct database access</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have the <code>jekyll-import</code> gem, you can convert a Wordpress
blog using a command like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>$ ruby -rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
    JekyllImport::Importers::WordPress.run({

      "password" =&gt; "lanyon",
      "host"     =&gt; "localhost",
      "status"         =&gt; ["publish"]
    })'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command will import from an existing Wordpress installation,
provided that your ruby code can access your database. This will work if you can
log into the server itself and run the command on the server, or if
the database is accessible across the network (which is generally bad
practice when hosting Wordpress!).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the status option: this specifies that imported pages and posts
are published automatically. More specifically, the YAML for each file
will specify <code>published: true</code> which will publish the page or post
into your blog. If you want to review each item individually, you can
specify a status of <code>private</code> which will export the pages into Jekyll
but leave them unpublished. Remember that if your repository is
public, posts marked as unpublished will not be displayed in the blog but
can still be seen if someone visits your the repository for your blog
on GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many more options than listed here. For example, by default,
the Wordpress-Jekyll importer imports categories from your Wordpress
database, but you can turn this off by specifying <code>"categories" ⇒
false</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_importing_from_the_wordpress_xml">Importing from the Wordpress XML</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another alternative is to export the entire database as an XML file.

      "assets_folder" =&gt; "assets"

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be used to export files from a server which you don’t
maintain, but works with sites you maintain and might be a more
plausible option than running against a database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To export the XML file, visit the export page on your Wordpress
site. This is usually mapped to "/wp-admin/export.php", so it will be
something like "https://blogname.com/wp-admin/export.php" (replacing
blogname.com with your blog’s name).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Like many free tools, there are definitely limitations to using this
method of export. If your Wordpress site is anything beyond the
simplest of Wordpress sites then using this tool to import from
Wordpress means you will lose much of the metadata stored inside your
blog. This metadata can include pages, tags, custom fields, and image
attachments.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to keep this metadata, then you might
consider another import option like Exitwp. Exitwp is a python tool
which provides a much higher level of fidelity between the original
Wordpress site and the final Jekyll site, but has a longer learning
curve and option set.</p>

<p>Jekyll provides various importers that make it easy to convert an
existing blog into a Jekyll blog. But, if you have a non-standard
blog, or a site that is not a blog, you still have options for
migrating it to Jekyll. The first option is to write your own importer
by perusing the <a href="http://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import">source of the
Jekyll importers on GitHub</a>. This is probably the right way to
build an importer if you plan on letting others use it, as it will
extend several jekyll importer classes already available to make
importing standard for other contributors.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another option is to simply write out files in the simple format that
is a Jekyll blog. This is much lazier than reading through the Jekyll
tools and their libraries, of course. I started as a Perl programmer and
always loved this quote from Larry Wall, the creator of Perl: "We will
encourage you to develop the three great virtues of a programmer:
laziness, impatience, and hubris." Let’s accept our inherent laziness
and choose the second route. We’ll write some code to scrape a site
and make a new Jekyll site from scratch, learning about the structure
of a Jekyll blog through trial and error.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While living in Brazil in 2000 I built a site called ByTravelers.com,
an early travel blog. At some point, I sadly lost the database and
thought the site contents were completely gone. Almost by accident, I
happened upon ByTravelers on Archive.org, the Internet Archive. I
found that almost all of the articles were listed there and
available. Though the actual database is long gone, could we recover
the data from the site using Archive.org?</p>

<p>We can start by looking at the structure of the archive presented on

search box in the middle of the page, and then click "BROWSE HISTORY."
You will see a calendar view that shows all the pages
scraped by the Internet Archive for this site as shown in <a href="#calendar-view-archive">Calendar view of Archive.org</a>.</p>

completing this migration, and then lost the data. If we click the
calendar item on June 6th, 2003, we will see a view of the data that
was more or less complete at the height of the site’s functionality
and data. There are a few broken links to images, but otherwise the

<p>Taking the URL from our browser, we can use this as our starting point for

each URLs to a journal entry uses a standard format; in other words,

journal item stored on the site. With this knowledge in hand, we can

<p>A naive implementation of a scraper would be a single Ruby file in
which the execution and functionality were contained all in one.
However, if we expose the functionality as a class, and then
instantiate the class in a separate file, we can also write tests
which utilize and validate the same steps as the runner script. So,
let’s take this smarter approach and create three files: the scraper
class, the runner class (which instantiates and "runs" our scraper) and the test
file (which instantiates and validates the functionality of our scraper).</p>

<p>There are two things that make Mechanize immensely powerful as the
foundation for a scraping tool: easy access to making HTTP calls, and
a powerful searching syntax once you have a remote document. You’ve
seen how Mechanize makes it simple to make a GET request. Let’s
explore sifting through a massive document to get the important pieces
of textual content. We can manually explore scraping using the Ruby
IRB (interactive ruby shell).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line invokes IRB and uses the <code>-r</code> switch to load the
scraper library in the current directory. If you have not used IRB
before, there are a few things to know that
will make life easier. The IRB has a prompt, which indicates the
version of Ruby you are using, and the index of the command you are
running. IRB has a lot of features beyond what we will discuss here,
but those indexes can be used to replay history and for job control,
like many other types of shells. At the IRB prompt you can enter Ruby
and IRB executes the command immediately. Once the command executes,
IRB prints the result; the characters <code>⇒</code> indicate the return
value. When you are playing with Ruby, return values will often be complex
objects: the return value when
you use <code>scraper.agent.get</code> is a Mechanize ruby object. This is a very
large object, so printing it out takes a lot of real estate, and we’ve
abbreviated the majority of it here, and will do that for many complex
objects to save space when discussing IRB.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last command in IRB saves the HTTP GET request as a page object.
Once we have the page, how do we extract information from it?
Mechanize has a nice piece of syntactic sugar that makes it easy to
search the DOM structure: the "/" operator. Let’s try it.</p>

<p>If our query path had found anything, we would have seen a return
value with an array of Mechanize objects, but in this case we got back an
empty array (which indicates nothing was found). Unfortunately, the
paths vary when the document is loaded into a browser (the browser can
customize the DOM or the server can send slightly different data to
the client). But, if we experiment with similar paths inside IRB, we
will find what we need. It helps to jump back and forth between Chrome
and IRB, examining the structure of the HTML inside Chrome and then
testing a search path using IRB. Eventually, we come across this search path:</p>

<p>Eureka, we found the pattern that gives us our title. We had to jump
around inside the results from the query, but we can correlate the
text on the page inside the browser with different structures found
using the query inside IRB. It is important to note that we have to
strip whitespace from the title to make it presentable. We can
incorporate this into our scraper code, but this is a good moment to
think about how we can write tests to verify this works properly. And,
when we start writing tests, we open the door for another opportunity:
caching to our HTTP requests.</p>

<p>Were we to run our <code>run.rb</code> script again, we would notice that it
prints the document title, then halts as it retrieves the content from
the server, and then prints again, stopping and starting until
complete. The content from Archive.org does not change at all since
the original site was
scraped years ago, so there is no reason we need to get the latest
content; content even several months stale will be the same as content
retrieved a few moments ago. It seems like a good opportunity to put a
caching layer between us and the code, reducing impact on Archive.org
and making our script run faster. In addition, if we structure our
code to make retrieval and processing happen independently, we can
write tests to verify the processing.</p>

<p>We require the VCR gem: this gem intercepts HTTP requests, sending
them out normally the first time, and caching all successive calls,
completely transparent to the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>VCR must be configured when you use it: in this case we specify a
directory where results will be cached, and tell it what mocking
library we should use to store the cached results.</p>

<p>We establish a new variable called pages. We will scrape all the
pages into this array (and get them for free once the information is
cached).</p>

<li>
<p>To use the VCR recording feature, we wrap any code which makes
HTTP requests inside a VCR block with a name specifying the "cassette"
to save it under. In this case, we use a cassette named "bt" (for
ByTravelers) with the index of the page. The first time we use the
scraper to request the page, it is retrieved and stored inside the
cache. Successive calls to the scraper <code>get</code> method are retrieved from
the cached responses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We then look for any titles which look like pages archived into
Archive.org (using the title to differentiate) and if we find one,
store that page into our pages array for later processing.</p>

<li>
<p>We move the title processing into its own method called
<code>process_title</code>. Here we use the information and remove any
whitespace.</p>

iterate over each page, searching inside them and processing the titles.</p>

<p>Output tags use double braces surrounding the

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The above template has both output and logic tags. We see a logic tag
in the form of <code>{% for …​ %}</code> which loops over each post. Jekyll will
process the entire posts directory and provide it to pages inside the
<code>site.posts</code> variable, and the <code>for</code> logic tag allows us to iterate
over them. If we use a <code>{% for …​ %}</code> tag we need to "close" the tag
with a matching <code>{% endfor %}</code> tag. Inside of our for
loop we have several output tags: <code>{{ post.url }}</code> outputs the post
URL associated with a post, for example. We also have "filters" which
are methods defined to process data. One such filter is the
<code>strip_html</code> filter which you might guess strips out HTML text,
converting it to escaped text. This is necessary when your text could
include HTML tags. You’ll also notice that filters can be "chained";
we process the body with the <code>strip_html</code> filter and then truncate the
text by 40 characters using the <code>truncatewords:40</code> filter.</p>

<p>If we open <em><a href="http://localhost:4000" class="bare">http://localhost:4000</a></em> in our browser, we will see a

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We start by looking at the second row and converting it to raw HTML.
We see there is a string "author: " which is a likely place to
reference the author. This string is wrapped by a "font" tag and a
"td" tag, so we can use these search queries to eliminate extra
information. Then, we convert the HTML to text using the <code>text()</code> method
and use a regular expression to pull out the text after the "author: "
string. If a regular expression matches and has a captured expression,
it will be held in the global variable <code>$1</code>. There is more than one
way to get this information, of course.</p>
</div>

<p>We need to rewrite <code>render</code> slightly. There is no need from the

<p>Then, we append the author and body content to generate the new
rendered output.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Our process body is straightforward: we convert each node passed
into to text (using the <code>text()</code> method) and then rejoin them with
double newlines. Markdown will properly format paragraphs if they are
separated by two newlines.</p>

<li>
<p>We then just need to invoke the <code>process_body</code> method and insert
the results into our processed hash.</p>

<p>Next we use the query path we found in our IRB session to retrieve
the author information, and insert it into our processed hash. The
author name will then be inserted into our YFM automatically within
the <code>render</code> method and we will insert it into the post.</p>

<p>When you publish a Jekyll blog, the fact that it is a repository on
GitHub makes it simple to manage and track changes. In addition,
because forking is a button click away, you can ask people to
contribute or make changes with very little friction.
You might have seen the banner saying "Fork me on GitHub" on many a
software project page hosted on GitHub. We can motivate others to
participate in our blog using pull requests. Let’s add that as a final touch and
invite people to make contributions the GitHub way. The <a href="https://github.com/blog/273-github-ribbons">GitHub blog
first posted these banners</a> and we’ll use their code almost as-is inside our
<code>default.html</code> page, just changing the reference to our repository in

<h3 id="_summary">Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We’ve explored the details of Jekyll, looking at the structure of a
Jekyll blog. Liquid Markup is a powerful way to use programmatic
constructs inside of a Markdown file and we document the most
important concepts around using this templating language. By
investigating the internals of a Jekyll post, we explained the
intricacies of YAML Front Matter (YFM) and how seamlessly you can mix
and match HTML with Markdown syntax. Jekyll blogs can utilize their
own custom CSS and we’ve shown how easy it is
to use a powerful complete library like Bootstrap layered underneath a
site specific small CSS file. And, we built a scraper application
which retrieves a remote site in its entirety and converts it into the
correct structure of a Jekyll blog. Even though this scraper application was
built specifically for a particular site, by adding testing and
properly structuring the components it should be evident how to reuse
much of the scraper for anything else you want to quickly convert into
a Jekyll blog.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the next chapter we will continue looking at Jekyll by building an
Android application that uses the Java GitHub API bindings and allows
you to create Jekyll blog posts with the Git Data API.</p>
